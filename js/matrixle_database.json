    "CommonApp": "“I think you should leave him and move on.” I said with determination. My mother was shocked at first, but soon realized the reality. Most children dream about having a perfect family: loving and caring parents that would take them to the park every weekend and have family dinners every night. I, on the other hand, want the exact opposite: I want my parents to be divorced so they can move on with their lives. To say my parents were not crazy about each other would be an understatement. They were not supposed to get married in the first place. According to my grandmother, the only reason they got married was because the societal pressure they faced in their late 20’s. And soon after they got married, I was born. I remember clearly, at the age of ten, I was told by my father that “I was the only reason they remained married”. Back then, I was not sure what exactly it meant. To a certain extent, I was proud of playing the role of this special “bond” that tied them together. I reminded them about their anniversary and helped to come up with gifts for each other. I wrote heartfelt letters to comfort them every time they had big fights. I cried with my father and my mother every time it seemed that the damage was too severe to be repaired. Despite all the ups and down, even when they were in the middle of a big fight, the idea of a divorce never came up and they still looked at me with love and smiles. I thought of myself as the last and most crucial defense to their marriage and it was my obligation to guard it. Last year, my mother was diagnosed with breasts tumors and needed a big surgery to remove them. Although my father did his best to take care of my mom, I could see that she was never the priority for him and he would always choose his career over the woman he married. One day, when I was helping my mother to recover in the hospital, she talked to me about how scared she was since the diagnosis, and she was afraid of not seeing me again. She also told me how my dad and her had grown apart over the years and there was no love left in their marriage. I asked why she was telling me all these things and she said she realized I am now a grown up and I deserved to know the truth. It was then I realized: for a while, I was proud of the role of keeping this marriage together. I thought my conversations, letters, and efforts were the main reason that this family stayed together. I could not have been more wrong. The only reason they chose to not to have a divorce was because they saw me as a child who needed to be taken care of. I was not the bond that tied their marriage together. I was the handcuff that locked them in this unhappy relationship. The next morning, I told my mother that I wish they should divorce so they could move on. I realized that for so long, my childishness and selfishness had blinded me from notifying the sacrifices they had made and the tears they had behind every smile they gave to me. But as I am about to turn 18, I should stop worrying about my happiness, and instead theirs. Happiness takes all kinds of shapes and forms, and the sum of their happiness should always outweigh mine. Sure I will miss the Sunday family trips and the family dinners. But as long as I know my parents are  happier than they were, it’s the least I can do to repay them.",

(100 – 300 words)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          The Lord of the Flies by William GoldingLanding on the island, Ralph cooperates with Jack to protect the signal fire and organizes time schedules for the kids. Ralph always insists on keeping the civilization of human. He tries to keep fire on mountain as a signal, refuses to use spears for hunting, and persuades others to seek fruit. The regulations apply well at first until some kids become aggressive and lose their desire to be rescued. ;Nevertheless, when all the cruel and inhuman murders of Ralph’s friends take place during Jack’s usurpation, I finally realize Ralph’s intentions. At the beginning, despite the circumstances, Ralph possesses a clear mind that if the signal fire turns into a tool only for satisfying people’s appetite then people would lose their sense and manners. Ralph’s character in the novel represents the roles of sages and intellectuals in our society- leading and enlightening society through truth and justice.  ; ;Consequently, after reading the process of Ralph seeking civilization and merit, I realized the book is more than just a reflection of the frailty and darkness of people. Even if the world is easy to bow towards the weakness of humanity, there are still some people like Ralph. They would be confused and bewildered about the world, but they are still righteous and always striving for the good of human nature. In The Lord of the Flies, William Golding depicts a picture to warn us about greed, temptation, and to “know yourself” in positions of power and evil. This novel has made me think about my place in society and how I would act if I were in Ralph’s position of power.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：58% of Wake Forest's Class of 2015 received academic credit for faculty-directed research across academic disciplines.

I decided to recreate Rubber Duck, a very popular art piece at the time and that was being exhibited around the world.I did a lot of research to understand the origin of it. I found that the reason why Rubber Duck was floating in Shanghai was because of a letter written by WABC, a public institution endeavored to help children with autism by teaching them to draw. I admired the mission of WABC for using creative ways to help children with autism. Inspired by WABC’s story, I created a collection of colorful plates made by children with autism.Thanks to this assignment, I found my passion in psychology and autism research. Since then, I participated in many autism related conferences and activities to gain more understanding of this issue.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Increased globalization and enhanced digitization are bringing people from different backgrounds and parts of the world much closer.

As the leader of the LGBT organization in school, I encouraged Jane to let others know about her true self. To my surprise, she said no. She told me that if people knew about her sexuality, it would create a lot of problems for her friends and family. She worried that some of her friends would no longer talk to her. And, although she knew her parents would support her, she worried about the embarrassing comments that they would have to endure. She decided that she would ’come out’ when she got a little order so that the people she loved the most would not be affected.

While touring the city our tour guide claimed that he had the right to decide where he wanted us to go. I later learned that this was common in Shangri-la because guides received kickback money from the places not listed on our itinerary. I tried to talk to our tour guide so we could travel to many spots as we planned. Not liking what I said, he threw our luggage out of the bus and left my grandma and I in the middle of nowhere. Outraged by his lack of professionalism, I wrote many letters to the local governing body to reflect what happened. Last year, new regulations were imposed to make tour guides more professional. Now tourist can focus on the beautiful scenery and culture of Shangri-la instead of worrying about being treated unfair by tour guides.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：How did you become interested in Wake Forest University and why are you applying?

I admire the fact that social engagements have become a part of the school spirit.Talking with ChunYu, a sophomore at WFU, I learned that I would find various opportunities to experience social education such as Hit The Bricks and Global Brigades. ;Academically, I like the series of programs about character psychology department focus on in the past six years. The video of the 2012 “The Character Project” was very inspiring to me because it focuses on the early development of character in children’s childhood. I look forward to being a part of these courses and studying characters and the impact of childhood.

He experienced the horrifying condition in which the master could plague slaves legally. However, he did not choose to use violence to overcome his problem. Instead, Douglass wrote three autobiographies to expose the life of slaves and became crucial spokesman during the movement of abolitionism. As one of the few men at the Seneca Falls Convention, he never wavered his support of women’s rights.As he wrote in the North Star, all humans are created equal, regardless of gender and race. While Harriet Tubman deserves to be on the ten-dollar bill for her contribution, Frederick Douglass deserves the “Hamilton” treatment for his contribution too."

Describe how you express your creative side.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I'm fascinated by animals, and that's why I have a small menagerie at my home, featuring insects, fish, birds, reptiles, and mammals. I take care of them every day, study their habits, and allow some of them to reproduce. I've studied how chicks and silkworms hatch, grow and reproduce. I've seen my corn snake prey on mice twice its thickness, suffocate them, and swallow them. I trained my ferret, and found that she loves digging at night. I've experienced birth and death. Though it's not the same as observing their lives in nature, I have still been able to get a good understanding of their life cycles. My menagerie is my treasure, my 'living textbook' for animal behavior. Because of this, I know things my classmates do not know about animals, and I am proud of that.However, to build a menagerie at home was not easy. My mom is a sincere Buddhist, so she always thought of setting my animals free. My dad, who graduated from China's best university, happens to be afraid of snakes. Thus, I had to investigate the living environment to convince my mom that if I did set my animals free in the city, they would simply die out there; and I needed to promise my father that I would never let my snake crawl out of my room. ;Naturally I took proper responsibility for my animals, including feeding, caring, waking, training, cleaning and playing with them, making sure my parents hardly even noticed they were present. Sometimes, my work made me think of those Renaissance biologists who secretly conducted autopsies under pressure from religion.I have lived with my menagerie for more than five years. Through it, I continue to study and explore life in various forms, expanding my interest in biology outside the classroom. It has become part of me both in terms of my daily life and my study/career goals. Though it has sometimes been painstaking, I have never even thought of quitting. And I have no doubt that I will carry this persistence forward in my future life and scientific pursuits. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          My mother is a big believer in Bach Flower Remedies, which use plant extracts to balance emotional problems. I wondered how this was possible, and so I took a Bach course to study it. I learned about the 38 plants the products use, and how the founder, Dr. Edward Bach, wrote that some diseases are the result of conflict in the mind and can only be eradicated by mental efforts. Flowers, he said, could help people to smooth over these mental conflicts. ;The explanation sounds plausible, but from my IB chemistry classes and knowledge of biology I knew it was not. Herbal remedies certainly can have an impact, but Bach remedies are homeopathy. This has no scientific credibility. ;So why is it so popular? Thinking back over all that I had learned, I concluded it could only be explained from a psychological viewpoint. That is why I took a summer course - The Science of Psychology - at Columbia University. ;This was a great educational opportunity to study the human brain, drugs, emotions, personality, and related factors. Most importantly, I learned about placebos, and how the body can cure itself when the brain thinks it should be healthy, irrespective of provable medical efficacy of a treatment. This, surely, is how Bach Flower Remedies work. It can't be anything to do with liquid itself which (like all homeopathy) is simply mostly water. ;Because of this, I became interested in the scientific principles behind popular pseudo-science. A lot of people believe in pseudo-science and I wanted to explore why. This gave me the incentive to learn knowledge from many different fields to look for possible connections that might help me to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. ;Similarly, if we want our scientific studies to have practical impact, we must also consider ordinary people's acceptance, ethics, politics, and even economic situation. This is why I do not intend to restrict myself within my favorite subject, biology, but rather continue to be open-minded and develop a multidisciplinary approach. That is my goal for study at the University of California. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe your favorite academic subject and explain how it has influenced you.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Since my parents both work in the biomedical industry, I learned human and animal physiology when I was quite young. My mother wanted me to grow up not only with an understanding of the human body, but also with respect for animal life. My father told me that organs could potentially be created via stem cells, and used for life-saving transplants. From that time on, the natural sciences have fascinated me. ;In high school, I chose higher-level IB biology courses. To further explore my interest in the life sciences, I interned at the Shanghai Tissue Engineering Key Laboratory, attending Prof. Liu Wei's project as a research assistant. We cultured cells to investigate the effect of keloid fibroblasts' morphology on their phenotypes, and did surgeries on rabbits to replace sections of leg tendons with new materials to explore their efficacy. I studied PCR and gene expression. Learning how science can make changes in living organisms to improve people's living standards was wonderful.Besides cell culture and PCR, I also learned to anesthetize mice and do dissections. I was reluctant at the beginning since I love animals. However, since it was necessary to unravel the mysteries of certain cancers and diseases, and find cures, I overcame my fears and did it. ;I want to continue my investigation on keloid fibroblasts since keloid scars are currently incurable. Many people suffer from this, including one of my friends. If we can change the keloid fibroblasts' gene expression and convert them into normal fibroblasts, then this problem will be eliminated. ;From my studies, I also see that political power, laws, ethics and social morality sometimes restrict biological research. I made a presentation on the topic in my Theory of Knowledge class. I discussed how new medical technologies had often aroused fear - for example, when Robert Edwards pioneered in vitro fertilization he faced hostility and public abuse for 'playing God.' Yet today most people regard this as an unremarkable medical procedure. ;Thus, as well as pursuing biology, I also hope to use multidisciplinary studies to maximize the positive social impact of the biological sciences.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Art and culture have always mattered to me. In my junior year, I became leader of the Paper Art Club, which focuses on traditional paper arts, including Chinese traditional paper-cuts and origami. Paper art has a long heritage in China, but is not popular these days - that's why there were only three members when I took over the club.Traditional art illustrates the history and spirit of a nation, and that helps make us who we are. In recent years the younger generation in China has been able to look far beyond the country - but has neglected the treasures nearby. I decided to try to reenergize the club to protect my beloved paper art and generate greater interest in it.A poster campaign and exhibition of my works drew six new members. None had experience in paper arts, but were attracted by my creations. That was exciting news for me, but also a little worrying since making fancy origami cannot be done without basic skills. That meant I had to make plans to teach new members the basics of origami and paper cutting, as well as to introduce the history of Chinese traditional origami. To ensure each member enjoyed the process, I organized team discussions once a month, so that we could share the interesting works we had made or seen, and solve each other's problems together. ;When we were making a 3-meter long Chinese dragon for an exhibition, I spent much time on embellishing it because club members were still new to paper arts, but I was appreciative to see that everyone was fully dedicated to the work, aiming to surprise the school with this traditional art. When we opened our exhibition, the vivid, supple dragon delighted the school's teachers and students. They also loved our hand-made bookmark bazaar. And from that time, the club has been well known in school, with more students joining us to learn about this art.Contribution to a community does not always consist of bringing in something new; it can also lie in our insight and dedication to preserving something old. ;"

    "CommonApp": "My Addiction to ReasoningSeeing Faraday’s Plate Generator in the introduction part of the textbook in physics class, I spontaneously sank into calculation and analysis to deduce the Magnetic Flux formula written under the picture using Lorentz Force, the micro formula to describe electron. My brain was  automatically trying to find the unification between two explanations, because unify is reasonable in physics.People always find me staring at something(may be one's face, sunset glow, equation, or a maxim), and actually I am submerged in unconscious analysis to make every object or phenomenon reasonable, and to make its explanations from different dimensions be consistent with each other. This tendency accompanies and shapes my growth. Before my learning of any laws of science, anything would likely catalyze this kind of unconscious analysis. Perhaps my first memory of this was when, in kindergarten, I disassembled a clockwork spring frog and found its jump related to spring’s returning. This relationship was what gratifyingly “makes sense” for little me and what latter helped me to easily understand that the returning was a conversion of energy, a more mature \"make sense”. As I grow, thorough understanding and explanation of what I encounter also melt into my addiction for reasoning. For example, on a plane, even tiny squares in a particularly eye-catching mode on the carpet drew my attention, and lured me to figure out the pattern underlying their positioning. I identified a larger square composed of several squares, eager to find out the ratio of the horizontal intervals to the verticals. I distinguished lines in six directions to find out the deviation of each row. Finally, though this behavior doesn’t have any practical meaning, I “perceived” the data related to their positions, because of my addiction.Later when the plane suddenly sped up, the intense unease sensation catapulted my desire to explain it. Initially, using plane as my reference point I thought it was feeling of acceleration like gravity— everything falls backwards. However I immediately realized that if I’m right, I should feel the same when I am lying upward, but this sensation obviously was stronger when its acceleration was much slower  than gravity. It’s paradoxical. Finally, I concluded that this paradox stemmed from the fact that the force was unevenly exerted by the seat only on my body part near the seat, thus creating instant different acceleration in different parts of my body, also exacerbated by elevated blood pressure, while acceleration from gravity is equal for every part. I cherished my addiction and the plane took off.As exemplified above, my addiction to reasoning shaped me and encouraged me to utilize my knowledge to practice my logical thinking ability.Not long ago, the book Animal Farm unsettled “unbelieving” me, making me concern about how ignorant the public is, and fear that maybe there is something wrong in current seemingly satisfying political system leading to the distortion of humanity, but as a member of it ,I, like characters in the book, just cannot realize these distortions. Fortunately, my “logical” analysis soothed my concerns. One feature differentiating current political form from former governing frameworks is that the current one originated with scholars in France who were not themselves in power, who were able to, as bystanders, create a system not largely affected by their interests. In most fictional dystopias, the central factor leading to distortions of humanity and society is the rulers' addiction to power. The prevailing tripartite political system and congressional representation were designed to avoid this concentration of power. This addiction turns unbelieving me into skeptical me. Now I’m at doorway to university,retrospecting the growth of my addiction. I confirm that it is time for the 18-year accumulated ability to thinking show its value.This time, my analysis will help in thorough learning knowledges and put knowledges further in university’s researches when looking for unification.",

I believe it’s time to make some changes.  ; ;Subsequently, I did a research in Dali Addiction Centre. I have learned that drug treatment and cracking drug trafficking are too specialized and the most practical action is to warn people with potentially high risk of drug use to get away from risky conditions. To figure out what risky conditions are, I surveyed 100 addicts.Currently, my friends have promised to avoid  ;risky conditions and I have organized publicity to disseminate risky conditions."

    "CommonApp": "It may seem odd, but where I was born was the very single thing that I considered the greatest challenge of my life. To me, my homeland Hohhot was like a cage with nothing but confinement. Having to take the advanced English courses in the capital, I found myself trapped along with other students here who also craved for more access to knowledge and opportunity in an invisible yet invincible way. Besides, Hohhot was too ethnic. Being constantly asked if I rode a horse as transportation, I felt a bit funny but a lot disappointed and embarrassed, because I wanted my hometown to be remembered for skyscrapers, flashing lights, and other items commonly connected with modernization. \"I am never going to catch up with kids growing up in big cities,\" I thought hopelessly every night before I went to sleep.This aversion against my doomed fate haunted me for a long time. The more intense my aversion was, the harder I worked, both in academics and extracurricular activities, so that I could get rid of the confinement. Until one day, due to my excellent school performance, I was elected to be the school representative to attend Model United Nations Conference where I represented the senator of Michigan to discuss equal right and opportunity for women. I conveyed my idea that the government should play a leading role in employing female staffs more fairly and set stricter regulations to diminish the impact of discrimination and glass ceiling in work place to establish a women-friendly society. More over, I was the first one to discuss gender stereotype in the conference and successfully inspired the audience including both female and male students to think more on the bias by introducing provoking work stories of Sheryl Sandberg in her book LEAN IN.   To my amazement, I won an award at last due to my in-depth thought about this topic and sincere speech. Ecstasy filled my entire body not only because I attained one more achievement but also because I learned a profound life lesson from it. I began to understand that though there was disparity between educational environments, it was definitely possible to diminish or even eliminate the gap with personal efforts. Furthermore, I began to accept the fact that only a small amount of people are nourished under the best condition, but there are also numerous outstanding people rising from the rest. So if I keep working hard in the way I did with MUN, I can make my achievement as well. With this insight, I began to view my hometown with a new perspective. I started to question if I was too narrow minded asserting modernization to be the only value of a city. Hohhot has its own charm coming from the Mongolian history and culture , which attracts thousands of tourists to visit per year. I have no excuse to resent this city, a place where I am born and raised ,but all the reasons in the world to appreciate and love it.“Do you ride a horse as transportation?”  The next time I am asked by this question, I am going to reply that the alpaca is more in fashion.",

As a university named after its city, NYU comes with the glamour of New York city. Three years ago ,when I first visited the city, I immediately fell in love with it. Walking in downtown, I excitedly observed everything around and captured a view exclusive to NYC: The yellow cab on my left was rushing on the street to take its passenger to a destination; A booth on my right was selling hotdogs and burittos just around the corner of an ordinary building with the rusted iron stairs hanging outside. Some young people of different racial types were walking out of the building talking and laughing. Noticing that I was attracted to the group, the guide told me that the building was a property of NYU, a unique school that did not have a campus. “The city itself is the campus of NYU,”the guide said. At that moment, as a person from another background and city, I perceived the open spirit and felt embraced as if the city was my other motherland and the school was a place I was destined to go.After the trip to visit New York was over, NYU became a beacon in my heart illuminating the path to my future and also the fire igniting my will to work hard. After long and careful consideration, I decided to apply for College of Art and Science and major of Economics and Mathematics, because I believe it is an interdisciplinary subject that prepares scholars best for the future. When I interned in Standard Chartered Bank in 2015, I found it very interesting to analyze economic phenomenon with mathematic knowledge. Besides, I have been actively participating in business simulation contests through which my logical thinking ability was greatly strengthened. With my intense interest in economics and strong ability in mathematics, I am confident to become a successful professional in Economics and Mathematics after the systematic learning in NYU.To me, NYU is extremely tempting because of its excellent location, comprehensive spirit and diversified courses , and it is the only university I secretly wish to marry if it were a person. Finally, I am so sorry there is no room for a love letter to NYU."

    "CommonApp": "Body-shaking, the Philosophy of LifeStanding by the dance floor, I started to regret coming. I felt awkward staring at people shaking their bodies as if no one was watching. Hello, I was watching, and you just stepped on your date twice.I didn’t want to attend the Winter Formal originally; my friends made me. “Oh my god, you have to come to the Winter Formal, even if you go solo. It’s part of your American experience.” What a smooth trick; they knew exactly how to get me. I’ll have to admit, this type of dancing isn’t normally my thing. It lacks…a purpose. After all, what’s the purpose of people cramming in the gym, jumping all over the place, and having to shout to even say hello. Just as that clumsy dancer saw my disappointed look, my very enthusiastic friends came to my rescue. “Come dance, Robbie! Put your hands up, and shake it, shake it.” Okay…I would raise my arms and, with minimal confidence, shake my body. I was confused. Against the booming music, I asked, “hey, what’s the purpose of all this?” “Purpose? There’s no purpose. Dance is just dance.” I stopped my horrendous body-shaking; those words struck me.For eighteen years, whatever I do, I always know why I am doing it. I waved goodbye to my parents and boarded the plane for the United States, because I knew a year abroad would add richness to my life. I commuted on Metro Line 11 four hours every day during summer because I found my internship profoundly important to the world. I came to this dance anyway, because it had a purpose – I had a possibility to explore. I seek for purpose because there’s a relentless urge for me to go somewhere and do something, to find the path that connects present to future. I relish such a path because it gives order to life. There is mesmerizing speediness, certainty, and focus to it. Life is incredibly random and subtle, so one has to observe, think, and plan carefully to seize whatever means available to achieve the ends.And yet my friend, who was now busy “raising the roof” with the biggest smile on his face, said there are no such ends to chase after. Dance is dance; life is life; a rose is a rose is a rose.To the deafening beats, I seriously considered his words. Could it be possible that I had been attaching too many personal interpretations to life? Had I been so absorbed in amorphous concepts concerning means and ends that I had neglected what was right before my eyes? Had I been missing out on life, while constantly chasing after it?I looked around; clearly, for the past three minutes I had been missing out. I searched for my friend and saw him doing the robot move. Far from being a pro, but it was fun enough. People were now forming up circles, taking turns to get inside and perform for the crowd. Even through the loud music, I could hear the claps and shouts and cheers. They seemed to enjoy the moment.Why shouldn’t I? I joined the circle, and its excitement immediately enveloped me. People were happy about my addition, “Robbie! Dance for us!” Sure thing; dance is just dance. Not caring about the purpose, I found my body miraculously free from stiffness – singing to the DJ’s song, shaking my shoulder, jumping up after a squat, I felt I could do anything. Gasps and wonders were vocalized from the crowd, and my heart felt happy.If you ask me if dancing at the Winter Formal turned my world upside down, I would say no. I still look out for purposes in life and try my best to pursue the ends. But one thing is certain: next time there is a dance, I will be the first to sign up.",

Seeing it gradually fade away changed me forever.“WHY DO YOU DESERVE IT MORE THAN US?” ;The cold February air froze at Zhang’s balcony. Zhang avoided my ardent eyes and fixed his on the lonely moon far above. He took a deep breath, tried to say something, but then paused midway. Never could I have expected my reunion with childhood buddy to go sour.“Why should students in Shanghai live the easy life? You do less homework, get all the possible opportunities, and then have better access to top universities. Why should we, students from small towns, who actually work harder, face more frustrating competition in Gaokao? What makes the difference? Noble birth?”I wasn’t born in Shanghai; like Zhang, I came from Dongxiang. My family left this sleepy small town only a few years ago. I deeply love my hometown.Zhang turned to me and fixed his eyes in mine, as if to demand an answer. I did not dare to say a word; his query remained in the air, striking in silence repeatedly. Education inequality was too delicate a topic to touch upon. I patted his back and tried to say something hopeful. “Just believe me. things will get better. Keep working and we may end up in the same college.” But the more I spoke, the more I found my words pale. A promise was too weak with words alone - I needed to solve the problem with action. ;But what exactly was I trying to solve? Discrepancy between Zhang and me? The problematic college entrance system in China? Or, social inequality? The vicious institution that tore two best friends apart? All of them, if I could. I had to help.Seeing the drastic difference between Zhang and me redefined my identity. I came to realize just how lucky I was. Not every kid from my hometown can move to cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Compared to my peers back home, I have been spending and taking much more than my share. Endowed with the resources others might not possess, I must shoulder greater responsibilities that concern more than myself. I want to work so that the less well-offs are better off. After all, our lives are not just our own. We live as a whole, as one species on this blue planet. We need each other. We are each other. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience that is important to you. What about this quality or accomplishment makes you proud, and how does it relate to the person you are?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I kept trembling; the thirty-second-long standing ovation overwhelmed me. I stepped up to the front of stage, took a bow towards the chapel full of students and teachers, and felt incredibly relieved and proud. Speaking out the hard truth about a community I so loved was no easy task, but I was glad that I made it through.Two months before my exchange year ended at St. Andrew’s, the upper school chaplain came to me and invited me to deliver a senior homily during a chapel service. “We all would love to hear your perspective,” he said. What an honor. I agreed immediately, promising him a good talk and gave him a big smile. However, when I started to craft my ten-minute script, I fell into utter bewilderment. ;It was not that I had nothing to say about this community; a year’s observation gave me more than enough material. I knew I wanted to direct people’s attention to the issue of inclusion, telling them how grueling my first few months were as a newcomer, and encouraging them to open up their worlds for the next new kid on campus. But I had a huge concern – the topic was so drenched with personal feelings that it might come off as a cacophonous accusation, one of those I-was-struggling-but-no-one-cared complaints. I did have a difficult time at the beginning, but it was nobody’s fault. I would hate to see my friends take upon themselves for the institutionalized indifference; I would hate to see them suffer.I could always turn to safer and easier topics - talk about Texan stereotypes, for instance. Such analysis from the standpoint of a foreign student would definitely bring sensational amusement. A love letter to football would work as well; everyone loves football here in Austin. I gave both topics a try, but the more I wrote, the more I felt the urge to go back to the discussion over inclusion. “What the community needed to hear must be said,” I decided. Never shall I let myself choose what is safe over what is important. I had to be audacious in the face of such a decision, even if it meant coming across as reckless to the entire school. ;In my speech, I poured my heart out. I talked about the agony of being left alone on campus in September, the joy of being surprisingly coronated homecoming prince that same month, and most importantly, the profound confusion in between. I said I really wondered why a community as friendly as St. Andrew’s could make a person feel so isolated at one point. I proposed that we make a difference together and make our friendliness more explicit. After all, no one should feel deserted.The speech was a success. Compliments and applause and hugs enveloped me, but those were not my biggest takeaways. What defined this experience was the risk I took in hope of prompting a positive change. It felt great because I was brave."

    "CommonApp": "I’ve always had my feminist beliefs but I didn’t always have the words for them. I am lucky that I’ve got a happy and equal family. When I was young, I never experienced assaulting words or rude behavior from my classmates. I used to believe the world was full of nothing but love and respect.However, things started to change when I became older. At the age of eleven, due to my father’s work site transfer, my whole family moved to Swaziland, where I encountered the term 'feminism' for the first time. While attending a seminar held by a senior female student, I learned that many females are suffering pressure and pain from prejudice and negative stereotypes. At that time, I also had the ability to read news on the computer by myself for the first time. When I read the discussion board under news about a woman who was raped, I saw that many people blamed her. They called her nasty words and said it was her fault for wearing too little.I was shocked. I could not believe so many people held ideas like this. I was really scared at first. “What if this happens on me?” I asked myself. I started to understand that I had only experienced a small part of the world. Many women do suffer unfairness and pain from other people.My mind became unprecedentedly clear. I wanted to help other people and me who have suffered or will suffer unequal treatment in the world. I remembered the student at the seminar who said that feminism is a belief in the economic, political and social equality of all genders and the objection to gender discrimination of any kind.Therefore, I became a feminist.My understanding of feminism deepened after I immersed myself in numerous books and articles about feminism. Li Yin He and Simone de Beauvoir became my favorite enlightenment teachers. The Second Sex became a must-read at bedtime. Back to China, I joined Lean In. At first I was only a volunteer, but my translation skills, maturity, and knowledge base granted me an exception to become the youngest and only under-age member.I tried to promote feminist ideas to the public by translating and sharing articles on the official WeChat account of Lean In Shenzhen, where thousands of people can read them. I also became an editor at the Female Leadership Cultivation Association. On the stage of these organizations I talked about sexual harassment and sexual assault and discussed how women can become truly independent and self-reliant. My own theories sublimated as I translated articles and discussed my ideas with others. Rather than just reading books at home, I started cooperating with people to run the organization, speaking out to influence others, and discussing feminism with people who read my articles.When someone asks me why I am a feminist, I tell them it is because I do not want to be limited to a stereotype. I tell them I decided to spread the idea of feminism so that more people can live for themselves instead of living “like men” or “like women”. My mother is a woman who is not “like women” in my grandmother’s eyes. She did not spend all her time on her children after marriage and she is still studying for her Master’s degree now. I want to protect women like my mother. I hope all men and women will not be limited to a stereotype.",
    "Supps": "题目：Tell us a story that helps us better understand a person, place, or thing you find inspiring.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          People make eye contact with each other every day, but most of us won’t notice it. For me, eye contact is really important and amazing. People say that the eyes are windows to the soul, and I see many people’s kindness and friendliness from those windows.My family and I often moved around to different countries, different cities in China, and different areas in the same cities to live. Therefore, I often had to deal with new communities and strangers around me. But I don’t feel worried because of my willingness to make eye contact with strangers. I found that when I make eye contact with strangers with a smile in my eyes, most of their eyes express kindness too. In this situation, all I need to do is to say a greeting, and then the stranger and I will start to communicate and we won’t be strangers anymore.As I grew up, meeting and communicating with new people became easier and easier. Sometimes even in places like elevators, which are pressured and uncomfortable, after making eye contact, I and others will be able to talk to each other with ease. Old grandmothers will ask me about my school. Parents will ask me whether middle school or high school is harder and will talk about their own kids. Little children will show me their lollipops.Sometimes all we need to do to break the ice is to raise our head and look at others with a smile in our eyes.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Tell us about a small goal you hope to achieve, whether in the next 10 days, 10 months, or 10 years.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I hope I can get the qualification of being a Level 3 Translator and Interpreter from passing the English Levels 3 translation and interpretation tests on China Accreditation Test for Translators and Interpreters (CATTI) in 10 months.I began translating when I joined NOVA magazine club in Grade 11. NOVA is a magazine where we post articles we translated from other sources. Since then, I have used and developed my translation skills adroitly, and by joining more organizations thousands of people can read the book and articles I translated.Translation changed the way I think. It teaches me to think from others’ position. I started to understand why many people keep silent when they experienced sexual harassment after translating an article written by a victim. After all, when facing the danger of losing jobs or degrees and the possibility of not being believed, we cannot expect victims to always speak out. Translation forces me to present and understand ideas that I may not agree with. This understanding helps me shape my own ideas and theories. I have become less biased and can see the experiences of others more clearly.Passing the CATTI does not only qualify my translation level, but also represents my mature thoughts. Translation helps me understand that while facing different opinions I should think “Why would they think that way?” and not “How dare they think like that!” It gives me patience to listen to different voices and the empathy to understand them."

    "CommonApp": "“Time for lunch!”I walked to the table together with Yue. It had been my daily routine for the past three weeks. Yue was six years older than me, still young and pretty. But, like the other workers at China-Dolls, an inspiring charity here in Beijing, she was sitting on a wheelchair. Struck by the rare disease Osteogenesis Imperfecta, she had suffered countless fractures since she was young.“So you are going back to school tomorrow?” she asked, taking some rice in her bowl.“Yup. Summer vacation is over.”“You really helped us a lot these days.” She smiled, ”We really appreciate it.”“I think I’m the person who should say thank you!” I said earnestly.Not merely an act of manners, this was purely the statement of fact. Ever since I first met a disabled boy at the age of 7 during a community survey conducted by my social-worker Mom, I had always been curious about disabled people. What were their lives like? How did they think about themselves, and others? On my path of seeking answers, frustrating obstacles always seemed to come along. Once I came up with a plan to communicate with deaf children through letters, and excitedly went to Haidian deaf school. But after waiting for 3 hours at the school gate blitzed by gusts of cold winds, I was finally rejected by a teacher decisively. How fortunate I was to meet Yue and her colleagues, who always solved these puzzles on my mind so patiently!“Well, why so solemn!” She obviously didn’t realize how grateful I was, “So do you have lots of homework during school days?”“Definitely.” My workload had been so gigantic ever since I decided to study in the US. Especially so, as I had chosen to remain in the Gaokao track and climb the ultimate sky ladder of Chinese high school education with all my dear friends. Time had become a luxury that I could barely afford. Every morning I got out the SAT books as breakfast, and every night, after I finished my school homework, I worked on my English writing. Even on the subway I remembered being consumed by mastering Chinese prose. It made me think that we actually all have our own challenges, even if they aren’t disabilities. We just struggle in different ways. “But up to now I can handle it.” I pulled myself together.“Cool. So you still have time for your hobbies? What do you usually do in your spare time?”“Well, I love swimming.”“Really? I love swimming, too! Swimming helps us OI patients exercise our backs and avoid scoliosis.”I looked at her thin legs curling on the wheelchair. I used to wonder how she felt about exposing her bent, strange body to the world. But since then I had totally changed my mind. When listening to their amazing stories, I admired them from the bottom of my heart. Seeing them steering the wheelchairs artfully in the office, busy organizing activities or raising money, I found that disabled people could have great ability. When I joined their dance party, where everyone, whether sitting on a wheelchair or on the floor, danced hand-in-hand, I learned how to bridge the gulf of ignorance. I had learned that, despite the difference between our bodies, we are all human beings after all. I finally realized the missing point of that deaf children project. Instead of “patronizing” the disabled as if some distant saints, we should ”reach out and understand” them.Seeing Yue’s face light up when talking about her favorite thing, I suggested, “So, how about going swimming together next Saturday?”She giggled, “Why not?”",
    "Supps": "题目：Describe your favorite academic subject and explain how it has influenced you. \n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I have been curious about sociology ever since I was young. With my Mom a professor of sociology and my Dad doing research on anti-poverty issues for decades, I was always surrounded by discussion of things like social stratification and discrimination. Our bookshelves were primarily occupied by books such as Durkheim’s Suicide and Tocqueville’s Democracy in America. Although I could not fully understand them, I was intrigued by the special ways sociologists view the world. ;However, even though my passion in this field has strived through all these years I have never learned sociology systematically since there’s no course in my high school. But I have groped for its meaning by myself for years. The definition of sociology is the study of social behavior and society, but that is a bit abstract. As far as I am concerned, sociology is a subject to present, explain and predict social phenomena. To me, it is like a magical window that engenders me towards tranquility and satisfaction. When looking through it, I find the clarity behind many seemingly unreasonable phenomena and understand better the behaviors of other people. Why people commit suicide? Why are there always wealth and poverty? There are hided rules behind them.Besides, unlike most other subjects I have studied, which seek an ultimate answer, sociology nourishes so many options, interpreting social phenomena from different perspectives. For example, the three basic theories-function, conflict and interaction, none of them is absolutely right. Rather, they are three different approaches. Although I used to be eager to find a completely right answer for everything, the approach of sociology makes me more composed and tolerant, accepting various possibilities at the same time.Sociology has always been considered useless in China. However I always felt it has a great deal to offer. When once working for a Chinese NGO called China-Dolls, founded to help patients with a rare disease, I was exposed to many stories of family struggles, and ways that poverty seemed to torture these people at every turn. I wonder if these problems can be examined with a combination of math and sociology methods, providing new, more creative options for policy makers to help these families. I really hope to develop this approach during my college years.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What is the one thing that you think sets you apart from other candidates applying to the University of California?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I never doubted that I was one of a kind, because I came from Mars.Well, please don’t laugh. Let me tell you my story with that distant, red planet.I remember asking my Mom hundreds of times when I was young, where did I come from? She was equivocal at first but, finally, she said to me one day, mysteriously, “You know what, you came from Mars!”Wow, that was a big secret. I tried to keep it to myself, but I couldn’t. I told everyone that I was a Martian. Of course, they laughed at me. Yet even as I grew up and began to realize how ridiculous this sounded, I still thought it was theoretically possible. Ever since the big bang took place, particles have been hovering around the universe for 13.8 billion years. Some of them now constituted me, but who knows where they were billions of years ago? Why couldn’t they have come from Mars? ;I was attracted by everything related to Mars. Lots of movies have depicted it, so often delineated as silent and lethargic, just like a desert struck by sandstorm. Martians were often portrayed as ugly, with callous hearts. But I knew Mars wasn’t like that. ;I often dreamed about it. Once I developed wings, and flew off to Mars for a visit. There were no humans, nor plants nor animals. I imagined some exotic “beings” who were not born to be anything. Instead, they chose what to be every day. If I wanted to be a sunflower this day, I became a sunflower. And if tomorrow I wanted to be a puppy, I just turned myself into a cute, fluffy puppy. Although there was no language, my “beings” could communicate through a special melody of the universe, a kind of a wave. ;I came to believe there must be some special relationship between Mars and me. I am always thrilled about the latest development in the exploration of Mars. With luck, one day in the future, I will have the chance to go home!\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Confidently I walked onto the stage, and introduced my applied math solution to the judges. ;Several weeks before, my Mom had bought various house plants considered effective for absorbing air pollutants. I was curious about them and hypothesized that there must be some relationship between the roughness of a plant’s surface and its ability to absorb. To find out, I started to design an experiment.The first challenge was finding a way to measure “roughness”, such an abstract concept. I searched for ways it could be quantified and thought of the method to measure machine parts. I wondered if that method could be applied to the surface of leaves. Browsing industry websites, I found a formula including three parameters for measurement. ;However, when trying it, I found there were so many fluffs on the leaves that it wasn't possible to measure accurately. Also, they were too soft when compared with machine parts. So I had to come up with some other way.Then, I remembered a BBC documentary The Secret Life of Chaos which introduced a concept named fractal, a math theory defining the irregularity of an object’s border and fractal dimension. Simply speaking, it used little squares to map out the border of an object, and then calculated its overall dimension according to a calculus formula. Could I adapt this to measure surface roughness? I had to try. Although it was usually used on the hard surfaces of planes, my subject was soft leaves. I experimented by crosscutting the leaves and, then, using a microscope, taking pictures through the lens. After several tries, I finally managed to get a good image, and, using some other specialist software I found online, I was able to calculate the dimensions of the leaves’ surface, and its irregularity or toughness.Having come up with these creative solutions to solve the most challenging issues, I was able to finish other more routine parts of my research smoothly. ;After my presentation, the judges complimented me for using a theoretical geometrical concept to solve a practical biology problem. However, it was the joy of experimentation that was my greatest reward. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time. \n                                  \n                                      \n                                          After co-founding a new charitable association among 28 high schools in Beijing and shouldering the responsibility of collecting and spreading charitable ideas, I suddenly found myself burning the midnight oil everyday contacting different charity clubs and summarizing their activities. Still, I struggled to finish the infinite work. I knew I had to take a different approach.Later I read about a theory called “monkey off the back”. Every monkey represented a single task, and a good leader has to delegate those troublesome monkeys to other team members. It felt so right! I could see that I had put too many monkeys on my back, and they had straddled me with their prehensile tails. I convened a special meeting of students from each member club.“I have a new plan to operate our association, and I need your help.” Spreading a paper on the table and writing down seven districts in Beijing, I said “Up to now we have recruited clubs from these districts. We should have one or two people responsible for the clubs in each district. They will get each club’s latest news, inform each club of the activities of the association and regularly report their work to me.” Then, I only needed to talk with several people instead of all 28 clubs - much less monkeys ;“But if we need suggestions when holding activities, can we still ask you?” a boy asked. ;“Well, you first need to talk to the one in charge of your district. I will still help you promote activities or contact other clubs, but I cannot talk with each one of you every time something comes up. Otherwise, there would be too many dialog boxes in my WeChat and I would start to forget things... People in charge will collect and tell me those questions.” I explained, pushing away another monkey’s arm about to put on my shoulder.  ;Happily, they seemed to understand my point. ;Once the administrative network was mapped out, I had full confidence that our work would be more effective in the days that followed. And after a while, it did make such a difference. I learned that good leaders have to “let monkeys off their backs”, while making sure that everyone is taking care of his monkeys!"

    "CommonApp": "In one of my childhood memories, the younger me was painting elatedly on a huge, white canvas, moving my chubby arms and humming a pleasant tune. I marveled as the different colors accidentally mixed together, roiling and thickening, becoming more miraculous—until my mother reached down and deftly grabbed my brush. Looking at me, she calmly stated that I needed to control my strokes more carefully. Then, she moved her wrist along the canvas, covering my melting pot of colors with her ordered, refined lines. I wanted to argue, but her skill was impressive. Careful control, I thought, was the key to success.A decade later, a chance encounter sparked my interest in ultimate frisbee, and inspired me to found a frisbee club at my school. Without much leadership experience, I naturally fell back on mom’s lesson to exert precise control. I personally chose the club’s name, Free Bees Ultimate, and planned our training schedule. Feeling the need to assert my authority, I would shout at them to run faster and fight harder, while they preferred to relax and joke with each other. I was frustrated. Why didn’t they care about the club like I did? Why wouldn’t they work to improve themselves? What’s worse, many people lost interest and stopped attending training altogether. I was shaken. The club was falling apart.One night, as I practiced painting, my club still lingered on my mind. I stared at the picture in front of me. Smooth curves, neatly separated colors. Perfect, just like always. Wait, not always. I remembered that sometimes, my mom would leave me to paint on my own, with nothing to stop me from doing whatever I fancied. I picked colors randomly from the box, used multiple brushes at once, and painted no less wantonly than Jackson Pollack. By the time I finally stopped, the animals I had meant to draw were unrecognizable, but in their place was a marvelous array of colors and shapes.Putting down the brush, my mind returned to the present. My team and I all wanted the club to succeed. Maybe rather than my guiding hand, the club needed to follow their passion.The next day, the Free Bees met for practice. Instead of deciding everything on my own, I started to ask the players for their opinions, and let them decide the practice regimen. Despite my previous emphasis on scrimmages, my members chose to play games such as ‘the box,’ which mixed useful drills with fun. Maybe I was wrong before; I should have been more open to the wishes of the team. So, at the suggestion of my teammates, I contacted the leader of my city’s frisbee league and invited him to give a talk to our team. That day, watching my teammates listen to the talk intently and then practice enthusiastically, I couldn’t help but smile.Several months later, we decided to hold the first ever youth frisbee tournament in China. This time we split up the work among the team, with each person choosing what he or she was good at. Finally, after months of intense preparation, I was proud to see the field filled with more than 100 young people from all over China competing and sweating together for the glory of sport. It was a tournament for teenagers, and more importantly, organized by teenagers. After an exhausting day, my teammates and I hugged each other tightly and threw ourselves on the ground. Amid the laughter and warmth, I couldn’t have been more moved.Now, I still paint. Delineating contours and filling colors, I know the importance of rules, but let creativity and imagination run free at the right time, and the canvas will be filled with free-flowing, brilliant colors. Whether painting or running a frisbee club, sometimes having control requires giving up control.Pencils sharpened, brushes cleaned, I can’t wait to start my next masterpiece.",

When I first read 1984 by George Orwell several years ago, it fundamentally challenged my idea of media and its function. Before encountering the novel, I regarded media as trustworthy stewards of information. But in the book things are different. At one point, the government misses its target for boot production, so it uses the media to retroactively lower the target. The corruption of the media is so complete that “even the date of the year had become uncertain.” Bothered, I took another look at reality, and discovered that information control wasn’t fictional: advertisements lie about their products; governments edit their poverty statistics... The book demolished my view of an infallible media and made me wonder: is any media trustworthy?In my junior year, when I founded a social media platform called UsTerns to transmit information about studying abroad to Chinese students, this question weighed on me. In every article I write, I feel the temptation to twist facts to my side. For example, when I was recommending a university, I researched upsides, such as the location. But I knew I had an obligation to present the downside, and I did: the school lacked facilities like libraries.I think I owe the success of UsTerns in part to 1984. It reminded me of my responsibility to the truth, and now my viewers regularly praise my even-handedness. 1984 showed me how dangerous media can be, and that is exactly what makes good media so important.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：We are a community with quirks, both in language and in traditions.

She’s a witch!”It was the first time I had carried my lunch to school, and people surrounded me, astounded by my bizarre dumpling accompaniment. Normally Chinese people eat dumplings with vinegar or soy source, and my choice, a mixture of traditional oriental food and freedom sauce, just seemed strange.But for me, mixing cultures is itself a very old tradition. It started two thousand years ago, when a troop of Roman soldiers visited Chang’an, China’s ancient capital. Most of them left, but some decided to settle down and raise families. That’s why many members of my family, which is from Chang’an, have blue eyes and curly hair. And this mixed identity is at the core of my personality as well as my appearance—besides dumpling philosophy, my slang, music, and movies all come from around the world. Once this bothered me and made me struggle to fit in, but as I grew older and traveled more, I found my traits could help me to better communicate with anyone. As I shared slang with Japanese friends and music with British ones, I realized my quirks made me not just Chinese, but a citizen of the world.Some years later, with renewed confidence, I decided to try again. I brought a big box of dumplings and ketchup to school for my friends. They were reluctant at first, but when they finally tried it, their eyes widened in amazement. I smiled. Sometimes good things come from mixing traditions together."

She just lost her mom, the amazing woman who had worked three jobs to make her college dream come true, but she has no time to moan. Today is her interview day that determines her family’s future.    This is all my imagination. I know nothing about that lady, but I often find myself reading other people’s life stories. I’ve never thought about people this way five years ago, when I had only two things in mind: homework and play. My life totally changed, however, when I started making pen pals.Daryna, a 15-year-old girl from Ukraine, emailed me one day in 2013. I clicked into Daryna’s profile picture in curiosity. In the photo, smiling at me with tender green eyes, is a pretty girl with long blonde hair. Her serene gaze seemed to break through the screen and come alive.Wow, this is what a Ukrainian girl looks like! I thought in amazement. At that moment, with the girl named Daryna quietly looking at me, the country called Ukraine was suddenly not so foreign. I felt an urge to learn more about the girl who I share a digital connection with yet lived a completely different life. Daryna lives in a small town in Eastern Ukraine and steps up to look after her five-year-old brother because her parents are often away. She draws beautiful water color and aspires to become an interior designer. One day Daryna sent me a photo of her neighborhood. Picturing myself standing between the gray brick buildings under the green trees, I tried to imagine what life is like for Daryna: how she walked home down that street, carrying her portfolio; how she sat and watched her brother riding on the rusty swing; how she bent over the easel and paint the petals on her flower. Hundreds of questions formed in my head. What makes her smile? Does she have the same adolescent worries as I do? At this moment while I look at her picture, what is she doing? Suddenly I want to get into Daryna’s head and experience her life for one day. Looking at the photos, I got a glimpse of Daryna. I felt her dream and affection. Although we are thousands miles away, our email exchanges have woven our lives together. I put one more piece into my puzzle of who Daryna is. Three months ago Daryna sent me a map of Ukraine with these words on the back: “I sent you the map of my whole country because you deserve to know it”. From these simple words, I could feel Daryna’s ardent pride of her country and her invitation to let me to go one step deeper into her soul. I stared into the little spot called “Korostyshiv”. There lives a girl I’ve never met, but our hearts are connected. Going through Daryna’s emails, photos, and map, I try to put together the puzzle of who Daryna is. Likewise, I try to put together the puzzles of the twenty pen pals from eleven countries I have corresponded with. However, after five years, I started to realize that the puzzles will never be completed, for the word “human” bears so much spoken and unspoken joy and pain. I can never really understand someone.  However, it is so amazing to think that our earth is alive with the sparkling stories of 7 billion human beings! How can I ever feel alone in the universe? I am connected to every human being in the world, my actions powered by the spirits of 7 billion people.  With the exchange of emails, that person on the opposite of the screen gradually becomes a person of flesh and bone. At the same time, the 7 billion souls become one organism—humanity.",

Classmates sent me twenty messages congratulating my courage, girls chatted with me about finding a girlfriend like it’s the most normal thing on earth, a teacher collected me into his arms when I told him, in tears, that the girl I like just got a boyfriend....... Nothing about me had changed—I’m still the drama enthusiast and a hardworking student. Free from the burden of concealing my true self, I feel an immense joy. ;“You are blessed to be in this school, Wanze. The school didn’t kick you out because you are a lesbian.” Hearing my teacher’s word, I really realized the weight of my school’s acceptance. In my mind I started to picture another possibility, where a girl has to conceal her identity and bows her head low from discrimination. I could have been that girl. ;When I look at my classmates, I often say to myself: these are my friends in life, my teammate in group projects, and, perhaps the most preciously—the people who accept me as who I am.

While I have a consistent passion for engineering and demonstrate it by taking the most rigorous math and science course in my school, I’m also attracted by arts and humanities because of the aesthetic and mental growth they give me. Therefore, the unique feature of School of Engineering that attract me is its blending of humanities and international experience into a vigorous engineering curriculum.  ;  ;Ever since 2008 when I saw on TV the destruction of the Wenchuan Earthquake, it has been my dream to become a civil engineer who can build seismic-resistant houses for people. Among the focus areas that the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department offers, I would like to choose Structural Engineering. The specialized courses like Structural Engineering and Design of Metal Structure will give me a solid foundation in this field; in addition, I’m looking forward to taking class with Professor Ann Jeffers whose research interest is “analysis of structures subjected to extreme load events”, the exact field I’m interested in. I’m confident that the abundant resource of the School of Engineering will make me well-prepared in engineering. ;Apart from engineering, the School of Engineering will allow me to maintain my interest in the humanities with its 16-credits requirement in Intellectual Breadth courses.

    "CommonApp": "That lady walking towards me has a sorrowful resolution, her lips pressing tightly together, eyes gazing straight ahead. She just lost her mom, the amazing woman who had worked three jobs to make her college dream come true, but she has no time to moan. Today is her interview day that determines her family’s future.    This is all my imagination. I know nothing about that lady, but I often find myself reading other people’s life stories. I’ve never thought about people this way five years ago, when I had only two things in mind: homework and play. My life totally changed, however, when I started making pen pals.Daryna, a 15-year-old girl from Ukraine, emailed me one day in 2013. I clicked into Daryna’s profile picture in curiosity. In the photo, smiling at me with tender green eyes, is a pretty girl with long blonde hair. Her serene gaze seemed to break through the screen and come alive.Wow, this is what a Ukrainian girl looks like! I thought in amazement. At that moment, with the girl named Daryna quietly looking at me, the country called Ukraine was suddenly not so foreign. I felt an urge to learn more about the girl who I share a digital connection with yet lived a completely different life. Daryna lives in a small town in Eastern Ukraine and steps up to look after her five-year-old brother because her parents are often away. She draws beautiful water color and aspires to become an interior designer. One day Daryna sent me a photo of her neighborhood. Picturing myself standing between the gray brick buildings under the green trees, I tried to imagine what life is like for Daryna: how she walked home down that street, carrying her portfolio; how she sat and watched her brother riding on the rusty swing; how she bent over the easel and paint the petals on her flower. Hundreds of questions formed in my head. What makes her smile? Does she have the same adolescent worries as I do? At this moment while I look at her picture, what is she doing? Suddenly I want to get into Daryna’s head and experience her life for one day. Looking at the photos, I got a glimpse of Daryna. I felt her dream and affection. Although we are thousands miles away, our email exchanges have woven our lives together. I put one more piece into my puzzle of who Daryna is. Three months ago Daryna sent me a map of Ukraine with these words on the back: “I sent you the map of my whole country because you deserve to know it”. From these simple words, I could feel Daryna’s ardent pride of her country and her invitation to let me to go one step deeper into her soul. I stared into the little spot called “Korostyshiv”. There lives a girl I’ve never met, but our hearts are connected. Going through Daryna’s emails, photos, and map, I try to put together the puzzle of who Daryna is. Likewise, I try to put together the puzzles of the twenty pen pals from eleven countries I have corresponded with. However, after five years, I started to realize that the puzzles will never be completed, for the word “human” bears so much spoken and unspoken joy and pain. I can never really understand someone.  However, it is so amazing to think that our earth is alive with the sparkling stories of 7 billion human beings! How can I ever feel alone in the universe? I am connected to every human being in the world, my actions powered by the spirits of 7 billion people.  With the exchange of emails, that person on the opposite of the screen gradually becomes a person of flesh and bone. At the same time, the 7 billion souls become one organism—humanity.",

Confronted with this unexpected task, our amazing teamwork made us survive and flourish. As the director and club president, I decisively chose an excerpt from our play with the help of a member and informed the actors of extra rehearsal. I then made a powerpoint with the photos and words another member provided. With every member’s contribution, our presentation was dazzling. A month later, our final play drove the audience into tears. ;I will keep doing Drama Club because I love the inspiring team behind it.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Everyone belongs to many different communities and/or groups defined by (among other things) shared geography, religion, ethnicity, income, cuisine, interest, race, ideology, or intellectual heritage. Choose one of the communities to which you belong, and describe that community and your place within it.

Classmates sent me twenty messages congratulating my courage, girls chatted with me about finding a girlfriend like it’s the most normal thing on earth, a teacher collected me into his arms when I told him, in tears, that the girl I like just got a boyfriend....... Nothing about me had changed—I’m still the drama enthusiast and a hardworking student. Free from the burden of concealing my true self, I feel an immense joy. ;“You are blessed to be in this school, Wanze. The school didn’t kick you out because you are a lesbian.” Hearing my teacher’s word, I really realized the weight of my school’s acceptance. In my mind I started to picture another possibility, where a girl has to conceal her identity and bows her head low from discrimination. I could have been that girl. ;When I look at my classmates, I often say to myself: these are my friends in life, my teammate in group projects, and, perhaps the most preciously—the people who accept me as who I am. As my school embraced me, I also embraced my real self, a process more impeded by my introversion than by sexuality. I started to show my real emotion and follow my own conviction. I’m proud of who I am, and I’ll never be afraid to let it show.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe the unique qualities that attract you to the specific undergraduate College or School (including preferred admission and dual degree programs) to which you are applying at the University of Michigan. How would that curriculum support your interests?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          In my mind, one thing that sets me apart from many engineering applicants is that I have a broad academic interests. While I have a consistent passion for engineering and demonstrate it by taking the most rigorous math and science course in my school, I’m also attracted by arts and humanities because of the aesthetic and mental growth they give me. Therefore, the unique feature of School of Engineering that attract me is its blending of humanities and international experience into a vigorous engineering curriculum.  ;  ;Ever since 2008 when I saw on TV the destruction of the Wenchuan Earthquake, it has been my dream to become a civil engineer who can build seismic-resistant houses for people. Among the focus areas that the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department offers, I would like to choose Structural Engineering. The specialized courses like Structural Engineering and Design of Metal Structure will give me a solid foundation in this field; in addition, I’m looking forward to taking class with Professor Ann Jeffers whose research interest is “analysis of structures subjected to extreme load events”, the exact field I’m interested in. I’m confident that the abundant resource of the School of Engineering will make me well-prepared in engineering. ;Apart from engineering, the School of Engineering will allow me to maintain my interest in the humanities with its 16-credits requirement in Intellectual Breadth courses. I first knew the charm of arts and humanities when I was looking at the painting “Vespucci Awakens America”. Carefully interpreting the slightest details, I heard the voice of 16th century speaking to me across the span of 500 years. I was intrigued by the magic of arts and humanities that liberates me from the material world and lets my mind roam freely in a broader universe. ;In my future college years, I will certainly be stressed out by rigor engineering courses.

    "CommonApp": "I had one minute to pitch my startup company, BlinkCard.During that minute, I explained the idea behind BlinkCard – “to supply a pre-paid debit card to teenagers, backed by apps that help them manage money with supervision from their parents.” As I paused for air, the investor didn’t even glance at me but stared intensely at the ground like Rodin’s statue of The Thinker. After a few minutes of rumination, he turned me down. “You’re too young. Focus on school.”Over the next five months, seven more investors rejected me.Just as hope began to fade, my dad took me on a brief vacation to California. Cruising down the highway, I recalled a Silicon Valley investor named Mr. Kong, whom I had once met at a MIT conference. Since we were in the area, I decided to pay him a visit.We met at a cozy coffee shop in Palo Alto. As I began telling him about my travels, Mr. Kong received a call. I glanced at the vibrating phone: there was a picture of a baby on the screen. Mr. Kong politely muted the call, but I insisted he should take it, sensing that the baby on the screen was his son. I sat there patiently as he spoke on the phone, thinking about my own dad who had just flown halfway around the world to see me. When the call ended, I asked about his son, who is no longer the baby on the screen, but now an executive at Uber. Mr. Kong confessed that he wished he had spent more time with his children when they were young. I was surprised by the relaxed and intimate tone our conversation had taken. Upon his request, I briefly showed him BlinkCard’s prototype and business plan. He shared his advice with me like a partner, or more so, like a father. When we parted ways, I left with no expectations, only good memories.    Over the next few months, I kept in touch with Mr. Kong, sharing an occasional story from my life, and asking for guidance in my development of BlinkCard. One night, I picked up my phone and saw a text from Mr. Kong. “I’m in for $150k!” In my shock, I dropped my phone. Later, I lay on my bed and tried to recall our meeting at that coffee shop. Why did he invest? I didn’t even explain all the details of the business plan. Could our casual conversation have been more effective than a well-reasoned pitch?My question was answered at the Wharton LBW Summer program. I had a conversation about entrepreneurial education with the founder of the program, Julian Krinsky. Afterwards, he invited me to his house for brunch with his family, where I learned that he emigrated from South Africa and became a nationally ranked tennis player. In turn, I told him about the culture shock I experienced studying in Germany and U.S., the process of conceiving BlinkCard, the frustration of facing rejections from investors, and finally the unexpected story of Mr. Kong in the coffee shop.Before I left, he handed me a thousand dollar check and said, “This’ll be another good story for you to tell!”At that moment, I understood the power of connecting with other people on an emotional level. To me, business is not strictly about cold numerical values, cutthroat competition, coinciding self-interests, or financial returns. Rather, business is another realm in which humans can relate to one another with empathy and sincerity; the goal should be to form lasting connections that can weather hardships and work toward the common good of all involved.I had meticulously constructed an elevator pitch intended to sell my idea to investors, but it failed. With Mr. Kong and Mr. Krinsky, I built a genuine relationship; they invested in my startup because they were emotionally invested in my stories—and I in theirs.",

Motivated to recruit, we put up posters around the school. Our marketing strategy wasn’t effective as they were mixed with the posters from well-developed clubs, like Model UN that touted their achievements and appealed to more students. ;We had no award, no funding, and no legacy. ;However, I soon realized we couldn’t change what we didn’t have but could amplify what we did have – the advantages of filmmaking for people to share their ideas and experiences. But we needed a creative way to deliver this message to others. One day, while in the bathroom, the idea of putting our posters on the bare wall above the urinal unexpectedly came to mind. Nobody could possibly miss this location and our poster! With no competition, the bathroom walls became our marketing area. ;Immediately, everybody in the school talked about the Filmmakers Club. My inbox grew exponentially. With a surplus of student endorsements, the principal approved the club, which has since grown to a strong team with 39 members. In the years since, we’ve created everything from advertisements for school clubs, to fundraising videos for a children’s cancer organization and an NGO that helps children whose parents are in prison. We also popularized the bathroom advertisement in my school! ;It was creativity that got our foot in the door, and I will bring that creativity to the Duke community. ;"

    "CommonApp": "Scars stared back at me as I looked in the mirror. I reached my hand out, as if to touch the suffering. I vividly remembered the moment that unexpectedly shattered my peaceful life. Like frames of a film, I could see the scene flashing in front of me. Tears fell from my cheek silently. I had fallen off a motor bike and smashed my face into the rigid cement. Blood burst from my mouth. Half of my face was paralyzed. I had no idea that my future would be met with ceaseless stabbing pain from acupuncture needles and multifarious medicines.I would spend Kindergarten in a mask, frequently visiting the hospital. I began to receive abnormal gazes from strangers. To make up for my obvious scars, I strove to excel in other areas so that people would pay attention to my achievements instead of my physical appearance. I worked hard in every subject, took part in mathematics competitions in primary school, and forced myself to read abysmal Chinese literature at very young age. I tried to be encouraging to others and show as much optimism as possible, often suppressing my negative feelings. But I was still afraid to smile until the day I met the 10-year-old girl in the community voluntary organization.Half-burnt face, with skin grafting evident, her leg had been amputated below the knee, and she walked with a crutch. She stood in front of me and I suddenly forgot the scars on my face. I felt an instant familiarity when our eyes met, immediately accompanied with grieved sadness and resignation.The next time I saw her was during Christmas pageant rehearsals. I heard shouting: “I will learn to dance! Like a swan!” I saw contempt, disdain, and scorn from the other children as she tried to dance across the stage. Memories of judgment came flooding back. I tried to avoid making eye contact. But her eyes stared at me, burning brightly. Her passion was like fire and extinguished others’ dismissal. She was filled with pride. Her artificial leg, exposed crudely in front of everyone, at first frightened me and evoked a shameful cowardice in my heart. Suddenly she fell down and I could feel the pain of embarrassment. But seconds later, she stood up, clenched her teeth, and continued on in the middle of the studio, rotating as if to reach the untouchable sunlight.The English Speech Competition arrived shortly after. Walking onto the stage, looking at the audience, I kept thinking of the looks that haunted my childhood. The moment my eyes met with the scornful eyes of the boy in the front row, I shrank back. I didn’t want think of myself that way. But I carried on with confident smile and raised my head as I walked to the podium. The burned girl’s face appeared in my head but was quickly met with resolve and determination. Half an hour later, speech completed with an impassioned tone, I shed my self-consciousness. Although I made some mistakes, I heard a roar of applause. I was stunned. I had finally stopped obsessing about what others thought of me physically. Three months later, the Erhu Level Examination forced me to go on stage again. Picking up the Erhu in the dusty corner, I thought of all my gloomy days practicing in a dark room. I was so fearful that I would make a mistake that would cause unimaginable consequences. Looking at the Erhu in my hand, touching the horsehair, my old friend was with me once again. I carefully held the scarred resonating box in my hands and began to play. I was totally immersed in the emotion of the moment. Finishing the melody with some imperfections, I raised my head up, smiled at the judges, and exhaled comfortably, appreciating the true beauty that is rooted in the imperfections of all individuals.",
    "Supps": "题目：Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time. \n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I am the leader of my astronomy club, which has 36 members that are divided into  ;  ;three departments: International, High School, and the Talented Elementary School Students department. In 2015, I attended the Sixth Developmental Astronomical Forum held in Shanghai, leading 8 members, including three members from the Talented department.Once we arrived, the 5 high school students became careless and left out the young gifted students as they discussed their plans for the conference. I was observing them and trying to make some changes to adjust the attitude of the high school students to optimize the overall team’s performance. Thus, I quietly encouraged the younger students to go and talk with the organizational committee. These students ultimately came up with several creative ideas for our presentation and provided well-thought out suggestions for us to present on a new technology that focuses on light pollution. At first I was simply trying to unite the team members but I was shocked that the youngest members of our group had considered the group’s goal so thoroughly while the older students had simply argued. Determined to take greater step towards fulfilling everyone’s potential, I further guided these three young boys to boldly communicate with the student leaders from The High School Affiliated To Renmin University of China about their previous experience. I did this in an attempt to discover the most important material to focus on to convince the judges of our club’s uniqueness while considering the two minute time constraint. ;It was apparent that the high school students, who were still arguing without progress, were unwilling to listen to me or the younger members of our group so I fought harder to convey the importance of balancing cooperation and individuality. Through these experiences together, the older group members realized their inadequacy and eventually, our whole group worked together.While leading this group, I united the team and ensured we had our best possible performance. I also learned an important lesson as a leader: regardless of my team members’ age or ability, I should never underestimate an individual’s potential contribution.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What would you say is your greatest talent or skill?How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time? \n                                  \n                                      \n                                          It is astonishing to think that the cumbersome, gray-like monster with a long neck, the Erhu, has been a part of my life for ten years now. Mastering the Erhu has required a truly massive amount of dedication. First, I had to memorize musical notes, then I needed to learn how to read music, and ultimately understand staccato, martele, common special signs. Since there is always friction between the horsehair bow and the strings stretching across the hexagonal body of the Erhu, I needed to understand which kind of rosin to use and the exact position my hands needed to be in so that I could produce the beautiful music that the Erhu is capable of making. ;However, even after fully understanding these technical skills, there was still more I had to learn. Sitting in the dark practice room, I was required to memorize different tunes and listen to various songs in an effort to feel the composer’s emotions. I learned about composer Abing’s frustrating life, with both parents dead, and being forced to witness the Japanese take over his hometown of Wuxi. He often incorporated his outrage into the songs he composed, and I had to learn to convey these emotions in order to play Abing’s Two Moons Over the Fountain perfectly. ;Through doing research on his life, imagining myself in Abing’s environment, and reflecting deeply on the musical choices in his composition, I worked to connect with Abing’s heart. I began to love this approach to music, enduring all kinds of difficulties and emotions through the music of the Erhu. Through many hours of practicing, my hands became covered with bandages; the strong pull of the bows often caused my arms to ache at night. However, I persisted and was ultimately successful: onstage performing Two Moons Over the Fountain, I felt keenly Abing’s resignation and sorrow, as if I had also lived through such tragedy. I was able to achieve a new level with the Erhu, living the music rather than just playing it.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement? \n                                  \n                                      \n                                          At the age of 6, I paralyzed half of my face after falling off a motor bike.  ; I was emotionally numb due to the over exposure to pain. Tears fell from my cheek, displaying a pink hue as they mixed with the blood that burst from my mouth. In that moment, I had no idea that my future would be met with ceaseless stabbing pains from other people’s glares in addition to acupuncture needles and multifarious medicines. ;To compensate for my conspicuous facial scars, I strove to excel in other areas. I worked hard in every subject, took part in mathematics competitions in primary school, and forced myself to read Chinese literature at a very young age. I tried to be encouraging to others and often suppressed my true negative feelings by fake smiling.However, one day when I was volunteering I met a 10 year old girl named Wuyue. I felt an instant familiarity when our eyes met, immediately followed by tremendous grief and sadness：Wuyue had a half-burnt face, with severe skin grafting. Her leg had been amputated below the knee, and she walked with a crutch. But within seconds of meeting her, I watched as she began dancing! Her passion was like a great fire that burned through others’ dismissal. Her artificial leg, exposed crudely in front of everyone, frightened me at first. Suddenly, she fell down and I could feel the pain of her embarrassment. But within seconds, she stood up, clenched her teeth, and continued on in the middle of the studio .I couldn't take my eyes off her every laborious step as she danced away my need to compensate for my own scars. ;She reminded me of why I began playing the Erhu because I enjoyed the solitude. I had never played for others before but after watching Wuyue dance, I decided to put on a public performance. I meticulously held the instrument in my hands and began my performance. Half an hour later, with impassioned melody and a somewhat imperfect music score, I managed my very first performance with satisfaction.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe your favorite academic subject and explain how it has influenced you.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I am fascinated by the subject of Human Geography because it requires me to critically think about how to apply human nature to the environment we live in.  ;I am specifically interested in the ideas of “ centripetal Force”, an attitude that unites an entire nation such as the Chinese Spring Festive and “ Irredentism”, the act of reclaiming an area, such as China reclaiming Taiwan as part of its country. I also enjoy discussing pressing issues including the Israel and Palestine conflict, and problems between the Soviet Union and Northern Ireland. My favorite part of the subject is contextualizing these situations through historical research that also allows us to gain a solid understanding of other global conflicts as well as analyze the strategies behind the development of certain countries. Thanks to the knowledge provided in this class, I have developed a great passion in analyzing broad world issues including political science and economics, and now understand how they are related to our daily life. All of the skills I have learned in my Human Geography class culminated when I presented on Boko Haram overtaking ISIS as one of the deadliest terrorist groups in the world. Specifically, the presentation skills of content fluency and body language that I gained from this experience were especially beneficial. ;To further understand the relationships between countries, I participated in the UMUNC 2015, General Assembly United System(GAUS). I negotiated with delegates from across the world about humanitarian issues in the Ukraine crisis. Representing Australia, I engaged in the United Nations General Assembly 3rd Committee- Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee. Specifically, we discussed whether or not Russia should accept refugees fleeing from Ukraine by considering the societal disorder or the excessive rebuke of the United Nations as well as the disputes surrounding petroleum resources between these countries. ;Taking AP Human Geography, I have seen how knowledge can be applied and how superficial my viewpoints once were. As a result, I would like to pursue political science as a major so I can research the many relationships between countries across the globe. ;"

    "CommonApp": "“The next station is Shau Kei Wan. Doors will open on the right.” The subway lurched to a stop.With a shutter click of our camera, I captured the final piece for our mission, a selfie with the indigo wall of Shau Kei Wan station. For this second “Rainbow Station Challenge”, Chris and I set out to take selfies with walls of the seven hues of the rainbows that embellished Hong Kong’s MTR stations.It began two summers ago, when returning from my first year in the United States, I noticed the security guard at my apartment no longer recognized me despite the years of conversations we shared in the past. And the bridge I used to pass through every day to get to the bus stop? Gone. My connection with Beijing felt rusted, and I suddenly became overwhelmed with nostalgia.Desperate to regain my lost localness, I chose to ride busses to retrieve my most cherished memory of the city. Taking only one specific bus line would have been lackluster, so I adopted a bigger challenge: I took the first bus that arrived at the stop, then got off at the very next stop to catch the next bus that arrived, again and again until I completed the “100 Station Challenge”.After walking through villages with unfamiliar names and arriving at countless dead ends within a day, I realized that Beijing, the city that I claim to come from, had grown without me, developing new spotlights and welcoming new inhabitants, while leaving me behind as a stranger. At that moment, I felt that my hometown was disappointed in me for leaving, and thus revoked my “Beijinger” identity as punishment.“Do you ever feel you are excommunicated by Beijing?” I asked Chris, another former Beijinger now living in Hong Kong.“Nope.” Chris responded without hesitancy, “Beijing is not a church, and there is no membership.”He continued while I pondered my misused religious analogy, “It is a tattoo on one’s back, barely viewed by the person himself, but occupies the body for a lifetime.”Many of my childhood friends never left Beijing and probably never will. They took my road not taken and planted their roots deep into Beijing’s soil. But as for many citizens like Chris and me, uprooting, transplanting, and readapting bestowed upon us its serendipities. We were no excommunicates—leaving home for another place was not a sin and personally speaking, it has been a blessing.Public transportation challenge series, which started from a hundred bus rides, was that amazing blessing. It revealed to me a unique way of immersing into different cities. In Hong Kong, I picked up both the notoriously difficult nine-toned dialect and high work efficiency; in Chengdu, I was taught to embrace life with passion while remaining composed at all times; in Rhode Island, I learned about New England heritage and the preppy dressing style on-site. None of the places I have lived in have failed to bequeath to me its idiosyncratic culture.Whether from trips on trains, subways, or buses, I invented an eclectic way of life of my own. Unlike my peers, I might have left my hometown too soon. But away from Beijing, my transportation challenges proved that though the road I took is less traveled by, it is as just as fair. As long as my trips continue to push me to new limits of understanding, Beijing’s influence on me will not vanish. Meanwhile, these different “homes” all taught me to view my next stop with hope, wherever that destination might be.“Please mind the gap between the train and the platform.” The announcement paused. I finished editing the photos on the platform soon after. In a few minutes, I would post these selfies online and a lot of acquaintances would see the post. My heart rejoiced because I can share with them my journey of epiphany.",
    "Supps": "题目：Vestigiality refers to genetically determined structures or attributes that have apparently lost most or all of their ancestral function, but have been retained during the process of evolution. In humans, for instance, the appendix is thought to be a vestigial structure. Describe something vestigial (real or imagined) and provide an explanation for its existence. -Inspired by Tiffany Kim, Class of 2020\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Three centuries after the first millennium in Anno Domini, an acolyte Adso left a manuscript on the scriptorium desk of the most splendid monastery in Northern Italy. In that elegantly rubricated manuscript, which later generations called The Name of the Rose, Adso recorded the flourishing monastic order under the Rule of Saint Benedict.Some great monasteries had incredible amount of power: They owned farms with tenants, traded with merchants for the finest goods, and were the most influential voices in society. They were the custodians of knowledge, the guardian angels of tradition, and harbingers of technology. It was the heyday of monasteries.Almost one thousand years later, the Portsmouth Abbey, a Benedictine monastery on Aquidneck Island (i.e. Isle of Peace in Wampanoag), still tolls the bell for compline every evening. And the monks, some of whom octogenarians, still follow the ancient Horarium. However, they compromise with an abridged liturgical schedule, or else only two hours of each day would not be involved with the Lectio Divina, the divine readings. And since a main portion of modern monasteries like Portsmouth Abbey has to include a school to survive, the lack of time would be fatal for those teaching monks.Besides living under religious vows, monks today are inherently different from their ancient counterparts. With just a few of them left, monks no longer make wines nor spend much time tending to illuminated manuscripts, instead aiding the homeless and the sick. Some skeptics might think that Catholic monks start their priesthood because they tend to romanticize it, chasing phantoms of the past, or even worse—they want to be taken care of.However, Father Paschal, an amiable teaching monk (the Funky Monk, as we call him) at Portsmouth Abbey School, has assured us that faith is the reason why monasteries still exist. He was an agnostic his entire life until his first mystic experience in a library. That moment was, directly quoting from him, “better than sex”. From that blissful moment, Father Paschal was able to give up the right to have properties, vacations, and a family. Every time he talks about that day with his students, his beard moves back and forth quite quickly from excitement.In retrospect, Father Paschal can still see the pious faces of his fellow priests who have passed away, the rare books in the Abbey sold for financial reasons, and of course, that moment of illumination. The monastic order may have outlived its peak and the monks are merely holding the rose’s name. Theymay be considered as figures of yesterday, but their reverence of God coalesces the monasteries of today. They still hold masses, promoting and giving thanks to Jesus’ forgiveness of sins regardless of time. One of the rituals that they kept from the olden days is the Gregorian chant (vocal lines in Latin), through the singing of which they beg for Christ’s mercy, on the people and on the monastery:“Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis...”(“Lamb of God, you who take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.”)\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：How does the University of Chicago, as you know it now, satisfy your desire for a particular kind of learning, community, and future? Please address with some specificity your own wishes and how they relate to UChicago.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Because of the ivies on the buildings of the main quad, because of the campus tour my tour guide Shree gave, and because of the most exciting prompts amongst colleges, the University of Chicago attracted me as a community. I would love to be a part of the school with diversity in all aspects, definite support of freedom and subsequently, its pedagogy.In high school, I took a class called “Faith and Church”. I walked into the classroom thinking I could learn about church history, but the teacher damned the use of contraceptives instead. In that “opinion-based” class, he referred to my opinion as “disrespectful”. Disappointed and disillusioned, I lost the passion to share my ideas in the class discussion.I felt like one of those UChicago students in 1947 who were persecuted under Broyle’s Bills, merely because they had ideas inconsistent with the tyrannical McCarthyism. In that case, UChicago proved to be a safeguard against indoctrination. Therefore at UChicago, I could finally form thoughtful opinions (e.g. contraceptives impact us positively) and try to defend them in seminars. In that encouraging learning environment, I will practice the school’s philosophy of “Audiatur et altera pars”: to listen even to the other side. And as a mutual intellectual exchange, the other side is going to listen to me.It is under the diversity and freedom of ideas that the art of learning is perfected at UChicago. Under the “New Plan”, the brainchild of Dean Chauncey Boucher, UChicago adopted the combination of the “Core” with other courses. I believe that with four years of liberal arts education at UChicago, I could take part in the dynamic academic conversation I listened to when I was an intern at Mogao Caves.I was following Professor Yu-min Lee from Graduate Institute of Art History in National Taiwan University and the Director of Dunhuang Academy into Cave 440, a cave of unidentified period and purposes. They discussed intensively about the carved lines on the lotus leaves on the columns. Seeing them got extremely serious about a seemingly trivial detail in an “insignificant cave”, I was drawn to the form of their conversation, a discussion focused on inquiry and debate (was that line added or original?), which UChicago’s active core classes are known for.Having seen so many statues and murals in anonymous caves, I wanted to speak on their behalf, as they could not voice for themselves. Missing their stories would be a huge loss because we would have fewer chances to find out the talents and beliefs of our ancestors. In my time at UChicago, I will be able to talk Michelangelo and Rembrandt with peers, and become insightful and eloquent in the language of art simultaneously.After I complete the Core curriculum, an 80-year-long broad-based conversation, I could join the art history professors’ conversation. Educated by UChicago in a comprehensive campus, I will pass on the passion for the caves, the appreciation of a small lotus leaf, into the hands of younger generations as how the professors passed it to me in the summer of 2016."

    "CommonApp": "During my first trip to Hong Kong, I indulged myself in a bookstore while my mother was crazily buying clothes from shop to shop. I have always been a fan of bookstores because I know, somewhere out there, I will come across a creative written piece that I am personally identified with.Wow! The Periodic Table of Heavy Rock! No sooner had I caught the first glimpse at that book, than I felt compelled to purchase it. On one hand, I am a science nerd who is willing to spend hours in the lab pouring one solution into another; on the other hand, I am a passionate rocker who yearns to relieve his power, shouting and screaming. How awesome is it to see someone I barely know integrating two major themes in my life into one commentary which could have been so technical and boring!The Periodic Table of Heavy Rock is indeed a fun book to read. The author matches each heavy rock band with an chemical element, justifying the “chemical properties” via substantial references to the musical masterpieces of that particular band. As a science nerd, I appreciate the elegance when chemistry language becomes an analogy to effectively express the hidden message. The structure of periodic table helps to explore the historical arguments between different styles and genres beneath the superficial description for bands. I bet, people with little exposure to chemistry might not thoroughly see how each part of “the periodic table of heavy rock” is inter-connected and thus suits the purpose of communication. As a passionate rocker, I cherish the sense of belonging that book brings to me. Flipping through pages, there are so many names and songs that I can recognize. I could still recall those hard times when my peers were all gossiping about popular singers like Taylor Swift, and all that I could do was to stare at them and barely say a word. In a sense, rock music is my second home, a palace where everything is familiar and pleasant.In addition to all these sentiments, interests also guide me to learn beyond the classroom. Believe it or not, when I want to kill some time, a random search on topics like Nirvana can be the first thing I go for. As I am exposed to multiple perspectives, my own arguments are gradually established. It was one of my proudest moment in the high school to stand in front of the history class, presenting the overnight flourish of Sex Pistols in the 1970s. Furthermore, the interest empowers me to hold on to the path of thorns. Having spent two weeks at Chinese Academy of Science, I am now able to confidently carry out some basic lab protocols, such as plasmid isolation and gel electrophoresis, techniques that I have previously read about rather than done. However, my first attempts at these practical skills were kind of awkward. At a laminar flow hood, there are plenty of chances to screw it up. However, for the precision of lab, contamination is not allowed. Anyway, I did make silly mistakes. Once, my instructor shouted at me because the bacterial culture was having a sweet little contact with the edge of my micro-pipette. I felt embarrassed when I had to start all over due to my lack of \"common sense\". Nonetheless, I tried my best to learn the scientific craftsmanship from loads of \"tedious\" repetitions. After all the successes and failures, I got to say, it is the interest that supports me through this “scary” journey, where I am the ignorant idiot to be laughed upon.In a nutshell, interests are the foundation for my whole personality. If I were not so much into chemistry and rock music, my life could be potentially altered.",

As a result, I would feel accomplished to become a rigorous scholar who generates new knowledge using fresh evidence with sincere endeavor. Meanwhile, I am also willing to dedicate my life to education, a career that passes on knowledge from generation to generation. Fortunately, my two ambitions are not mutually exclusive.Academically, I intended to apply for the honors program to investigate Chinese history. Despite the superficial exposure to historical knowledge in my high school syllabus, I am grateful that I have come across many compelling thematic issues in both contemporary and ancient China, such as early medieval China, nomadic empires, cultural revolutions etc. I understand that, deep down inside my blood, I am a Chinese person, and I desire to explore how the past constructs who I am. Therefore, in the past few years, I have read a huge array of books discussing different eras in China. The Red Rock tells me how the flourish and recession of Chinese rock music signified changes in the political climate in a narrotological approach, whereas On the Cusp between Wei and Jin Power and Networks during the Transition rigorously investigates how distinguished families of the Wei Empire gave rise to the shortly unified Jin Dynasty with substantial academic references. I am thrilled by the various angles how historical researches can be conducted.  ; ;Personally, I would like to do some tutoring work at the local community. Teaching has been my interests for years; it feels awesome to see my students overcome their obstacles and finally succeed. Up till now, I have done many tutoring jobs in my spare time, ranging from English for rural kids to Chemistry for my fellow peers. From these practical experiences, I am aware that teaching styles need to be adjusted based on the targeted audience. While colorful pictures are utilized to teach vocabulary for young kids, the syllabus-based approach is more suitable for my peers. There are so many types of students in the world; for each type, I need to develop specific methods in order to become a qualified teacher. In this sense, Macalester is the perfect platform for me to further develop my skills. During my college research, I get to know Nick McMullen, a current junior who has been volunteering at a local charter school as part of Educational Studies. Therefore, using the resources offered by Macalester, I can put my thoughts into practices and bring benefit to the local community.In conclusion, I will maximize my academic potential and take the advantage of existing resources. Ultimately, after I actually become a popular teacher in the near future, I hope I can look back and say that, it is Macalester that cultivates those essential qualities."

    "CommonApp": "Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.One day, when I descended toward the metro to get to primary school, my eyes were drawn toward a billboard of sparks flying out of a man’s mouth. It was a show in the Cirque du Soleil tour themed after a horror movie. I made sure to get tickets for its upcoming performance in Shanghai.At the time, my only expectation was to see a guy shooting sparks and embers out of his mouth like Charizard. However, there were unbelievable acrobatics as well as magic tricks beyond my young imagination. Specifically there was the ‘Globe of Death’ with 7 motorbikes in a steel cage ball. I held my breath until the last motorcycle was safely at the bottom of the cage.What I saw was totally impossible for me to understand. How did they reach the top of the inside of a steel ball without falling down? And how did they steer their motorbikes accurately in pre-calculated angles so that they will not bump into each other?Later on I was asked by my tutor, “What do you want to do when you grow up?” I said, “I want to join the circus,” with an odd determination. To put my ambition into practice, I started with basic techniques and worked up accordingly with risk and difficulty level.Juggling was the first step I took. It looked simple but required practice. The next step was a leap though: Every morning, I woke up with my unicycle beside me. Every day, while gleefully riding on my unicycle, I felt myself moving closer and closer to my dream of being a female motorcyclist.At first, my parents were amused by what they thought was just another kid exploring her curiosity. They assumed I would get bored by the frustrating and arduous practice necessary to master these skills. But when they found out how committed I was starting to become about riding a motorcycle upside down in a steel cage, they almost begged me to stop spending time on such dangerous pursuits.Unfortunately for me, everything changed after entering middle school. I could no longer focus on my circus skills with my diminishing leisure time. Yet it seemed like the only thing I could still be excited about…until one day, my physics teachers taught us about centripetal force. The mystery on the Globe of Death peeled off: that was the force keeping the motorcycle's tires stuck to the walls of the sphere.As the secrets of circus were exposed, the acrobatics I had regarded as magic and supernatural were no longer as glamorous as before, in my mind. It was so easily explained by science and suddenly removed from an invisible pedestal. What’s worse was that it was boiled down to easy-to-understand concepts. As the perfect impression was crushed, I did experience a period of disappointment. I could hardly abandon my unicycle.I pushed myself to think about the relationship between circus and science. There should not be a winner or a loser. I questioned myself: was an act itself intriguing me or the science behind how it happened. My answer was: both. I enjoyed doing circus skills myself as well as exploring the hidden mysteries. And of course, a circus is only a small application of science. But it drew me into a broader world abound with mysteries.Now, I dream of donning a lab coat instead, but I’m still thankful that the imagination and wonderment of the circus helped me find what I am truly passionate about. Dreams can mature from fantasies: And I still ride my unicycle, the cradle of dreams.",

As a teenager, I would suggest it to my peers at a time in our lives when everything seems too black and white: school is hard, life seems complicated, and the value of simplicity is overlooked. I believe this story is exactly how to explain that less can become more.Through the colors he used to depict this town, I find that Shen’s pure love and enthusiasm towards nature are directly conveyed. He makes full use of the clarity of water as the background and colors without breaking harmony or peace. Through words, he preserves natural beauty he perceived during childhood, and sought solace in during warfare. ;Also, the context of The Border Town shows Congwen’s simple sympathy towards a minority called the Miao who practiced a determined will against any form of violence. Different from the remarkable works constructed on troubled times, it is prudently set in the two years after a monumental revolution in 1911. Only within the peaceful and serene town could the Miao characters could grow up in an idyllic and natural state: No more massacres or poor children carrying heads chopped by soldiers. No one caused the tragedy. But why did it happen? ;I came to see beauty within sorrow. It is letting nature take its course. It is life: we break down and meet up again…just like the moon’s reflection dims or shines, waxes or wanes upon the town’s waters. ;The significance eluded me because it was obvious. After reading this book, I realized that even though Shen wrote the story in a simple way, it doesn’t mean that the lives of people are simple. And this extends to the good and the bad. Understanding that, makes it all the more digestible.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What have you done to challenge or change that which outrages you?

They were not only wasting crafting resources but also spoiling artistic potential. ;I asked them why they abused these materials. ‘But, they are trash,’ they said. I responded, ‘Oh really? What if I told you that in 5 minutes, it could become a purse?’I selected a large piece of cloth with a unique dye. After drawing a design graph directly on the back of the cloth, I fixed the parts that needed to be attached to each other with staplers and a glue gun. Turning the cloth inside out, I completed this simple but stylish purse. ;And thus, I converted the first members of my Eco-Crafting club.

I was curious about how this technology could address similar or greater problems that other people deal with.So, I investigated the effect of light wavelengths on a substitution reaction as my chemistry internal assessment. This typical reaction shows a strong tendency: fastest under 460 nm wavelength (blue light), and slowest under 725 nm wavelength (red light).But through that practical, I still had difficulties relating wavelengths to human physiological reactions. Therefore, in WFU, I would like to participate in undergraduate research to deeply explore more human-related reactions.

Yet, when I type ‘wireless history timeline’ in Google, the first step noted was how Guglielmo Marconi develops the first wireless telegraph. Maxwell, to me, is undoubtedly the Father of Wireless. ;Although he is known by the public for the complicated Maxwell’s equations, his influence in facilitating the practical use of wireless facilities is underestimated. Even in Ivan Tolstoy’s biography of Maxwell it is stated that: “His importance in the history of scientific thought is comparable to Einstein’s (whom he inspired) and to Newton’s (whose influence he curtailed)”. ;I too, thought it was interesting to suggest that important figures of the past may have gotten by with less to show for it.

Indeed, with special decorations, unlimited food and coffee, and activities like battling zombies, I am sure that I can stay pumped about studying.But I look forward to learning beyond books also: The two greenhouses and animal facilities nearby Winston Hall may allow me to connect nature to human physiology. Some issues within our bodies are solved naturally, like how beetroot juice affects blood flow as discovered by professor Daniel Kim-Shapiro in WFU. Outside, I can find not only to scientific inspiration, but also amazing hiking experiences. I want to learn survival skills by Belews Lake or in Hanging Rock State Park. I like working outside and I’m glad that’s a theme at WFU, where I’m sure I’ll have great success connecting nature and science."

    "CommonApp": "“Quitting vigorous exercises because of dysmenorrhea is nothing embarrassing,” said my doctor.I believed it firmly till I asked the academic principal, Mr. Dawson, for his permission to skip a PE lesson, “It’s ...girl’s problem, sir.”Mr. Dawson picked his icy eyebrow, “Fine. I spare you for the PE,” words came out from his thin lips, “and for the whole day. Leave school now!”“But, sir...”“Now, leave!” His voice sounded cold, with unquestionable authority.A sense of grievance poured into my chest, and my eyes were full of tears. But, I dared not to argue. I did not want to end up worse like my classmate who had been suspended two days’ lessons after challenging Mr. Dawson’s rules of managing student activities.When I explained to Ms. Jessica, our administrative director, why I had to request for an early leaving, she comforted me, “Don’t worry. I will talk to Mr. Dawson.” I saw a glimmer of hope from that - Mr. Dawson might change his mind if Ms. Jessica stood up for me; if not, I would not be blamed at least. I accepted Ms. Jessica’s help without hesitation.   Mr. Dawson said nothing when I met him at noon. I delightedly assumed that he had been persuaded to take his order back. However, he came to me before the Geography class, with the leaving request, “Sign the paper, and don’t let me kick you out.”Mr. Dawson commanded every student to follow his directions under any circumstance, and I was no exception.I walked down along the hallway to Ms. Jessica’s office, with useless tears. Curling up in a corner, I waited for my mother to pick me up. Somehow, I remembered that I used to curl up in a corner of my mother’s closet when she was about to leave for Suzhou and I dared not to ask her to stay or take me along. I only held her clothes and cried myself to sleep, hoping that mum would come back home on her own, as I hoped Ms. Jessica could solve the problem for me. I had never changed in the course of years.I questioned myself, “Why did I always count on someone else to save me from my dilemma? What if I stand out for my own and get what I want?” I couldn’t help thinking if I could have talked to Mr. Dawson by myself, I might still need to go back home, but I could walk out by myself instead of being kicked out in such an embarrassing way. It was at that moment I realized I must step out from my safety zone and endeavour to do everything on my own.I recalled that day a lot - the tears I dropped on the playground, along the hallway, and in the administrative office, and how timid I used to be. I reminded myself to make changes, so I did. I came to the Ms. Sara for her advice during office hours on my additional analytical papers and college choices instead of just getting A in US History and walking out of the classroom soon after the bell rang; I struggled for another chance of interview when I was informed the Inscribed Steels Museum only recruited adult volunteers, and I won the position due to my touching passion; I ran for the student leadership and was determined to take over the cooking club when the initial founder graduated this May...Though sometimes I still hesitate, I am more willing to push myself forward and fight for my own, and that is a great progress.The girl hiding and crying in her mother’s closet will never come back, neither will the girl with tears wishing others to strive for her stay. I guarantee that.",
    "Supps": "题目：Richmond values not only the students' academic potentials but also their responsibilities for the real society. Describe a recent story or event that has impacted you most and feel free to share us your views and thoughts and how they are related to Richmond.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          “Orlando nightclub massacre: Deadly shooting at Pulse gay bar.”“Breaking news from Orlando, Florida...”Almost all the mainstream media posted the news of the gay bar attack in Orlando, with different headlines but the same shocking tones, in the afternoon on June 13, 2016. I could not help noticing the news as they kept popping out one by one.Homophobia was said to be a main reason for Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, the gunman, to commit such a crime. As I clicked my mouse and saw the cruel pictures of the crime scene, I questioned, “How could someone kill and injure near one hundred innocent people just because of homophobia? If homophobia could be a good reason for the crime, what about other severe social problems such as racial discrimination, religious discrimination, political conflicts, etc? How much bloodshed will be costed until people realize violence is not a good way to solve social problems?”Lost in great grief, I couldn’t help thinking that putting up nonviolent resistance may be a better way to pursue social changes as well as maintaining peace. Howard Zinn engaged in the civil rights movement by teaching black students at Spellman College; Martin Luther King and Malcom X fought for racial equality by making speeches and writing articles. Their nonviolent resistance contributed to the end of segregation and improved racial equality. In contrast, some African Americans protested violently for the shooting of African Americans by white policemen and caused injury of ordinary people and the police. Their violent protest didn’t help solving racial problems; instead, it triggered more hatred between races and worsened their relationship which was already intense.Behind most violent mayhems are resentful people who find no better way to present their opinions other than hurting others. If there could be a course that teaches people how to solve injustices in a civilized manner and how to make the world hear their aspirations in a harmless but powerful way, they would take relatively peaceful actions when they have strong opinions about some problems. Supposing the gunman who caused the mass shooting in Orlando ever had a chance to learn about how to express his opinion toward homosexuality in a moderate way, the tragedy might have never happened.Should I have the chance to be a part in University of Richmond, I wonder whether I could make a proposal to the academics committee to open a course regarding nonviolent resistance. Associated with the mission of University of Richmond, the course could lay stress on teaching students to pursue social reformations, be responsible for their community and the whole society, and stand mighty for peace. Besides, as nonviolent resistance is a subject closely connected to social issues, it could help Richmond students to become future social activists, pacifists, and global leaders."

    "CommonApp": "My mum is no good at cooking. She puts sugar instead of salt in chicken soup, boils vegetables into a mush and the best dish she makes is instant noodle. There have been so many mistakes in the kitchen that I even could not remember them all.When I was young, my father took charge of cooking. But following my parent’s separation, not only did my mum have to work, but she also had to learn cooking. I saw immediately that this was challenging and unnatural for her, and I began to worry. Not only were we not eating well, but mum was obviously exhausted from work. So, after hundred times of failure, I finally said to her, “Don’t worry. I will learn to cook.”My first time cooking, I was barely as tall as the counter, and it was difficult in the beginning. The first dish I attempted was a fruit salad. Unfortunately, I made it using unwashed fruits, and accidently made my mother sick. My first time stir-frying vegetables was equally unsuccessful, and I was burned by the splattering hot oil. But after thousand times failure, I began to improve. I learned to make sweet and sour pork, my mum’s hometown dish. When she ate it, I could see that it released her homesickness and comforted her. Soon, I learnt more recipes so that I could take better care of mum.As I continued cooking, not only did I grow into a decent chef, but I saw our family relationship change. Prior to my parent’s separation, I was used to seeing traditional families: fathers or mothers need to work and take care of the elderly and the young. For children, the task is basically to be taken care of. Following my parents’ separation, however, I saw these roles didn’t make sense in our situation. Instead of hiding under the protection of my parents, I needed to care for them. I admit, at first I didn’t like this new burden. The kitchen was hot, and cooking was difficult. However, from cooking reluctantly and complaining, I slowly began to enjoy it. I liked receiving positive feedback from my tasty dishes. But my greatest sense of accomplishment didn’t come from compliments. After I took on the role, mum seemed more energetic and relieved of stress. Seeing her this way, I felt proud to accept this special family responsibility, even if it’s slightly different than others. Cooking was a gift, and I was glad to share it with mum.More personally, cooking helped my family to rebuild our relationships and gave me the insight and maturity to adapt from this change in my family. When they first divorced, I felt like a girl who forgot my way home. What would our family look like? Would may parents still love me? Cooking helped ease those fears. Each night, we’d sit down and eat together the meal I prepared, and this was my way to bring stability back to our household, building a bridge between us for communicating and expressing love. I’ve heard many people say single parent family means that the kid must lives in a broken family, but those meals I share with mum showed me we were not broken at all. My family might look a little different, but we are loving and united.As time goes on, my family continues to change. I’ve moved away to boarding school, where I live alone in an apartment near campus. Meanwhile, mum moved to Zhuhai for work, but visits every other weekend, and when she’s here, I still make sure to cook for her. This simple act is not only a bond of love between us. It has helped me redefine my family and find my place in it, offering me an opportunity to become a mature, responsible adult and contributor to my precious family, one dish at a time.",

One way to improve sustainability is organic farming. However, because of high cost and misconceptions about safety, it is hard to spread organic food in China.In senior two, I attended China Thinks Big, a research and innovation contest. During the competition, my group presented research on the current state of organic farms and customers’ opinions of organic food. To educate citizens about the process and advantages of organic planting, we also created an activity called vegetable diary, where we encouraged citizens to grow their own soybean plants.Although the competition is over, I’ve continued to fight for sustainability by giving out articles on Wechat. I hope this can help spread organic concepts and protect our environment.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Communities Essay\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Shenzhen Middle School, where I’ve lived and spent the last three years studying is regarded as the most democratic school in Shenzhen, or even in China. We have both central Student Union and committees elected from every class to discuss school rules, and almost all non-class activities are planned and led by students. With such great freedom comes responsibility, and when problems arise, it is students who need to stand up and address them instead of waiting for the administration.I am a member of Student Union equity department, a student group tasked with addressing student grievances. As such, I act as liaison between students and administration to find solutions to problems like the rise in price of cafeteria food or allowing use of cell phones outside class. Generally, we solve these problems ourselves, or for bigger problems, we conduct panels between directors and students to work together to find solutions. Before my experience in Equity Department, I even did not notice there were so many problems in our school, but within the first year, I gradually cultivated the habit of noticing latent problems and moved from passively accepting problems to actively changing them.The democratic atmosphere of our school helps me become a student who raise questions actively and fights for solutions immediately instead of sitting and waiting. I’ve not only become a proactive and determined problem- solver, but also I gain further understanding to justice and equality, fighting for the rights in other situations.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Why that College or School?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Architecture has long had a place in my life. As the daughter of two architects, I received introductions from my parents about buildings from a young age. I distinctly remembered a trip to Washington, where they introduced the strange, unique Seattle Library to me. With its abnormal shape, I couldn’t help but wonder, “Why did architects design it this way?”Throughout high school, I’ve had many opportunities to begin answering this question and learning how to think like an architect. For example, in grade 10, I participated in a mathematics modeling competition, HiMCM, where our group was tasked to find a solution to a traffic problem. As we combined math, physics, and design to solve the problem, I felt inspired seeing how design could be employed to solve social problems and knew architecture and urban planning were something I wanted to continue to explore.Thus, last summer I enrolled in an architecture career discovery course at University of Hong Kong. My mornings at HKU started with workshops and lectures, where we learned architecture concepts, landscape design, urban planning, preservation and conservation. Afternoons were filled by studios, where we designed our own projects based on given assignment. The program helped solidify my goal to study architecture in university.I hope to continue my architecture journey at University of Michigan Taubman College. Taubman’s academic approach is diverse and cross-disciplinary, offering architecture, urban design and urban planning fields of study and providing a curriculum that emphasizes the change architects and urban designers can bring to positively change the world. Taubman’s facilities are particularly impressive. Besides the beautiful, newly renovated building, Taubman also provides many rare, high-tech features, such as the specialty Digital fabrication lab. These industrial technologies will introduce me to state-of-the art tools and make me familiar with the most recent advances in architecture.Outside of the classroom, Taubman provides many opportunities for students to experience architecture and explore personal interests. As a research institution, University of Michigan provides opportunities like the Architecture Student Research Grant that allows students to explore their creativity and start making a difference even as an undergraduate. Beyond campus, Taubman also provides many architecture-related study abroad opportunities. After reading previous students’ experiences about study abroad on Michigan’s website, this is an aspect of Taubman that is particularly exciting to me. Opportunities like Spring Travel Courses or summer half term travel will allow me to interact with architecture face-to-face, understanding the cultural and historical meanings of local architectures while engaging with local students and expert architects. For instance, visiting traditional Europe cities can allow me to further understanding architectural history, while traveling around modern cities gives me more inspiration on design.Lastly, Taubman’s extensive career services train students in job seeking strategy and help them accumulate experience in architecture, both before and after graduation. On-campus workshops, Career and Networking Fairs, and Spring Break Connections externship programs broaden my future career prospects and help me get closer to my goal of being a working architect."

    "CommonApp": "It was a typical family dinner to celebrate my uncle’s birthday. While the adults were busy cooking in the kitchen, I was going around and looking for John, my little cousin, whom I hadn’t seen in a while. In a small bedroom of my uncle’s home, I found John sitting there and doing his homework. My aunt, who I admired for her independence and dedication to her job as a banker, was sitting close to him to make sure he finished all of his homework. The scene was déjà vu. Growing up, my mother has always been very strict with my studying too. We used to argue all the time because she would not allow me to do anything but studying. When I wanted to learn singing, she said no because she worried it would take up my studying time. When I wanted to play badminton, she said no because I might get injury that causes me to skip school. When I was selected as the lead delegate for our school’s Model United Nation team, I had to sneak out of our home to go to practices because my mother believed those activities were meaningless. In her mind, going to college was the only way to have a good life. However, despite all the argument, I never blame my mother. When my mother and aunt were in elementary school during the Cultural Revolution, they were required to pick up firewood, cut grasses, and do farming work. They barely had enough time to read and study. In order to read, they had to use candles to light up the room at night. During the long winter in the north, their hands and feet were covered by chilblains after reading. To them, at a time that everyone was destined to be a farmer, studying was the only way for them to change their destiny. They put all of their spare time into studying, got into college, and became successful in life. As I grew up, I came to understand my mother’s belief and tried my best to comply, especially after my parents divorced. However, while I understand the importance of education, I believe time has changed and there is more than one way to learn and success means not just going to college and get a good job.Table tennis, one of the few things I was allowed to do by my mom during my spare time, taught me how to be persistent and patient when facing an obstacles. Model United Nation, something that I really enjoyed doing because of my interest in history and politics, taught me how to present my argument logically and objectively to convince the audience. My mom did not know about this, but I read a lot of web fiction during my spare time. I was fascinated by the utopian world these writers described and surprised to learn how talented successful these writers are. These none-studying learning experiences have helped me as much as studying. At first, my mother was skeptical. However, as time went by, she saw how much I grew up because of these activities that I did outside of studying and started to change her perception. I would always try my best in school and be the best student I could be. However, I needed my mother to know that learning can be done in various ways and it is not just what I learned in book, but in life, that matters. I enjoyed the time my mother spent watching me do homework because she taught me the importance of education. But I am about to go abroad for college, I need to let her know her daughter is a lifelong learner, who sees success with a broader definition and can learn from both inside and outside of the classroom.",

From a young age, her life was filled with hunger and poverty, which urge her to use education to change her life. Without qualified teachers and course content, she had to rely on her own for the most part. Such ability not only helped my mother in her study and career path, but also helped her to be persistent and strong.

Staying with her all day enabled me to inherit such spirit of exploration and persistent into my own life. ;From a young age, I started jump the rope jumping everyday to maintain my health.

After I grew a bit older, I learnt various jumps. I wound play the recording of some of my favorite films to distract my tiredness when jumping. I explored numerous methods to persist in exercising everyday. And now, I had persisted nearly eight years.The notable thing was not that I kept on exercise everyday for myself but my courage to fight for my spirit of exploration and insistent. These successes strengthen my courage and insistent and I hope such will could add to the diversity of the Brandeis University."

    "CommonApp": "The school bell rings on an ordinary Friday after lunch. The classes of the week ended, but the most enjoyable part of my day has just started.I walk into our band's practice room, seeing all kinds of instruments to compose beautiful music - two pianos along the wall, violins and drums in the back corners, my seat at the front of the room. Whenever I walk into the small practice room, it always feels like walking into a new world, with music and harmony filling the air. The pianos play a low sound, controlling the flow of the music. The violins take the lead at the high pitch, following the rhythm of the pianos. The drums highlight the rhythm, giving it emphasis. As for myself, I play the flute and my role is to accompany everyone and contribute to the harmony. I still remembered the time when we formed our small band. The different instruments, the different interests in musical styles, the individual egos; initially we could only produce a big cacophony, with no prominence or harmony. Thus, we quickly learned that there's no way our band would make it playing as individuals. We sat and talked, somebody had to take a step back. There was only one person who could take the lead, but everyone would still play a necessary part. Now, every musical instrument has its own place and function in our band, though the audience may not notice every contribution in our performances. Being a necessary part of this small band in our small practice room, I can really feel the power of music, the power we produce when we all cooperate with each other. After band time, school time is over. But for me, it is time to go on my weekly cycling trip. Being the leader of a group of cycling enthusiasts, it is my responsibility to organize all the trips, and this week, I planned for us to ride to the river bank, a place I have long been thinking about visiting. Before leaving, I made sure that the route was correct, the weather sunny, and the first-aid kit in my bag. Crossing the streets, feeling the road under my bike, I feel the freedom that I control everything. Arriving at the river bank, I ride along it, and I feel the wind passing by, blowing up my hair and clothes; it feels like the sensation of flying. Every riding trip is a new adventure. Riding on my bike, going to some place I have never been, seeing new sights and meeting new people. Sometimes, I stop and chat with people along my way. I love to hear their stories, and to tell them about our group’s past adventures. It is just what my adventuring spirit is about, going to new places, and meeting new people. After riding, I return home for a quick dinner and I set up my computer to open the chat group with my math modeling peers. In math modeling, I love the adventure of tackling new problems. I also love cooperating with my math modeling partners to build the best solutions to each unique problem. In our group, everyone has his or her own responsibility, from building the model like the lead soloist of a band, or writing the main structure of the report like the piano leading the flow of the tune. Some jobs may seem less important, but a comprehensive and insightful solution cannot be produced without the collective efforts of all of us. Maybe that's why I choose math modeling to be my interest and explore it in my spare time - it fulfils my adventurous and collaborative spirit. And that's what I would like to after graduation - use my knowledge in math modeling to contribute to important work in economics, healthcare, or the environment.",

Thus, Math just naturally became my perfect companion - an equation, a theory, a rule, math provides me a language to communicate abstract ideas and a methodology to understand the logic underlying coincidences and phenomena. And since grade 4, I’ve explored my interest in math theory by participating in individual and team math competitions. I have participated in AMC several times to further test my ability, and have scored in the top 1% several times. ;However, it wasn't until I was introduced to math modeling that I realized how I could apply what I learnt all those years and how I could use math to make the world a better place. Since, math modeling has occupied most of my spare time. Together with three of my modeling peers, we spend loads of time together, analyzing problems, building models, applying our solutions to all kinds of real life problems. ;Math modeling provides me with the chance to fulfill my adventurous and collaborative spirit and to contribute to important work in economics, healthcare, and the environment. Collaborating with my math modeling team, we have addressed many problems varying from Canadian Elk population growth to evaluating city safety rates, in which we developed a rating system based on crime data provided about a city in two weeks' time. With all the data we received, we were able to investigate the effect of foreign population, time periods of a day and different days of a week on city crimes rates, and also generated a rating system based on the different severity of crimes happening in the city. Through exploring math modeling, I have also developed an interests in computer science due to the utility of running simulations using Matlab. The knowledge in computer science really aids my research, and the rigorous logic in programming compels me to explore further.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          For two years, I have been the leader of the cycling club in our school, with about thirty members in the club, we have been the largest and most gender balanced sports club in school. Being the leader of this large group of people, it is my responsibility to plan for our cycling trip every week. ;During all these years of cycling, our team has traveled to places such as Thames Town, rural areas outside of Shanghai, and a memorable bike ride to Chong Ming Island, which lasted for three days Of course, a lot of preparation has to be done before the trip. Every week before starting the trip, I check and make sure that the route was correct, the weather sunny, and the first-aid kit in my bag.For me, crossing the streets, feeling the road under my bike, I feel the freedom that I control everything. Every time I ride along the road, feeling the wind passing by, blowing up my hair and clothes; it feels like the sensation of flying. Every riding trip is a new adventure. Riding on my bike, going to some place I have never been, seeing new sights and meeting new people. Sometimes, I stop and chat with people along my way. I love to hear their stories, and to tell them about our group’s past adventures. It is just what my adventuring spirit is about, going to new places, and meeting new people. ;Besides organizing the trips, I spend a lot of time propagating our club and cycling as a way of life. Every semester, I give speeches to attract new members to our club. When I started, there were only two girl members, but now two years later, we have become the largest sports club on campus with more than twenty members and half being female. ;I am very proud for all these changes in our school and the results of my hard work and effort.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Since I have been in the same school since primary school, I have looked for opportunities to give back. In grade 10, I joined the student union and ever since I have been working as the head of the secretariat department. However, the student union is not the place where people tell you how to do things directly—it is where we learn how to figure things out by ourselves.I still remember the first task I received. I was assigned to be in charge of the decorations of the whole school for Halloween with a budget given by the school that was definitely not enough. After days of thinking, I went to the art teachers in the school and set up a jack-o-lantern making competition to promote students' enthusiasm for the activities and to gather decorations. I also searched for old decorations from the past years, and with my peers we made some more with paper and ribbons. We spent hours and hours and finally all the work paid off. I was quite surprised what us students could accomplish together with a little ingenuity. ;After that, I continued to receive all kinds of different activity organizing tasks to do, from designing the sports competition for the school, which involves students from grade 7 to grade 12, and different activities were designed for different grades. There were fun and simple activities such as \"Simon says\" and more cooperative activities such as dodge ball. Besides, I even took part in the school's annual charity performance by working backstage and organizing the microphones. ;These experiences have enhanced my ability to organize activities, to take up responsibility, and to adjust to changing circumstances and challenges. Through helping my school community in the student union, the experience has come to define a great part of me.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          For years, I have been greatly interested in music - and this led to my decision to learn the flute in middle school. Since then, I practice my flute for more than half an hour each day. Then, I started to perform solos during small school concerts, but began to yearn to play in a band with different instruments and peers to collaborate with.In high school, I finally had the chance to start a band with my peers. I quite enjoy being in our small practice room, with two pianos along the wall, violins and drums in the back corner, my seat at the front of the room. Being a band with most of the instruments for classical music, we started practicing classical music pieces such as Pachelbel's Canon.But as time passed and we became more and more fluent playing music, we wanted to do more. We decided to explore the culture difference between Chinese traditional music and Western classical music by using by playing Chinese traditional tunes with our classical instruments to converge and highlight differences between the two kinds of music. I was excited our band had the chance to be invited to a performance called Clash Of Culture, where we found a lot peers with the same thoughts as us. I still remember that day on the stage. The pianos playing a low sound, controlling the flow of the music. The violins took the lead at the high pitch, the drums highlighting the rhythm, giving it emphasis. As for myself, my role is to accompany everyone with my flute and to contribute to the harmony. It was not the same as the feeling of traditional music - the sound we produce is more bright and hard, but still fluent and nice.After that, we have continued this kind of exploration on more kinds of music, such as modern music, in which we use classical instruments to play the popular Billboard songs. Through this experience, it improves my ability to step outside the norm and create new things."

    "CommonApp": "“I think wires are too rigid, so they should not be considered for weaving together to make a frame.” “Glue sticks are not as strong as super glue, so let’s discard them.” “Are you sure you need beads and feathers to decorate a poster?”When I was designing a three-dimensional poster in the art classroom, my friends would occasionally give me these kind pieces of advice as they passed by. My friends’ words were constant reminders that there are defined limits for all materials. But secretly, I love thinking about things in a “perfected form” and then listing what is required to achieve it, not just for the materials required to achieve perfection in arts or sciences, but also for people.Because of my good performances in Math and the sciences, I was praised as a “good material for scientist,” which is the literal translation from Chinese slang. However, still curious about my own potential, I decided to drop one chemistry project to make more time to create News Expresso: the not-yet-existing student online media that would become an alternative for the rigid content and dry language of our official school magazine. Having curved a wire to make the stand for my three dimensional poster and having melted glue sticks to add feathers for decoration, the “good scientist material” found some courage to start a new form of school media. After I found myself reading the same sentence over and over again in our school’s newspaper and still failing to digest its meaning, I knew it was time to try for myself.I am not the best editor, but I am skilled at gathering talented people who are. Thanks to all of my lab experience, I am used to creating a defined set of procedures and breaking it down into detailed working plans for every member. However, just like wires alone cannot make a stable structure, I needed to find my “glue.”Candice’s name was the first, and best, to pop up in my mind. She is an “endangered” newspaper-reading species in the 21st century. She is someone who still reads the school news several times a day and also would rather skip a meal than put down an exciting new book. Candice is like my glue stick, holding together areas where my deficiencies make it hard to do it. It is possible for us to support the whole club.  “Are you sure that I can be the head editor?” She asked hesitantly. A shy girl with abundant emotions hidden under a peaceful smile, Candice has a kaleidoscopic inner world which is only open to me. Can a shy person lead a team?  Possibly. Can a shy writer create a magazine with an extroverted science student? Probably. I persuaded her to give it a shot.The chance I created for us was like adding heat to a glue stick, changing the material from a solid form to a liquid. Gradually she melded into the form of someone who is much more comfortable with communication. And with her meticulous editing and useful insights, I was finally able to produce acceptable articles on my own. What we couldn’t achieve alone, we achieved together by helping each other become more versatile “materials.”“Would you like to help run the online school official newspaper this year?” An email from school headmaster read. Candice finished her cup of coffee and mentioned the name Joe. “It seems we need a programmer now.” I immediately dialed Joe, the computer science genius. While wires and glue stick could make impressive artwork, feathers, beads, and other decorations could make it truly stand out. “I know nothing about managing the backend of a subscription account, do you think that I can...” Joe’s voice was full of uncertainty.“Yes, let’s try!” Candice whispered behind me and I repeated her words into the phone.",
    "Supps": "题目：Why are you drawn to studying the major you have selected? Please discuss how your interests and related experiences have influenced your choice. Specifically, how will an education from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) and Cornell University help you achieve your academic goals? (Please limit your response to 650 words.)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I select food science as my major without much hesitation. Being a foodie and recognized as top student in my science class, I have always been curious about how to make food tasty and healthy by applying science. It is part of my life.I love fresh figs, but couldn’t help noticing that many times they are easily spoiled by improper packing. Therefore, I designed a ventilating box to transport fruits in bulk while maintaining their freshness after comparing different preservation methods.Conversations in family kitchen also inspired me to do my own research on food science. Recently my father, a well-educated person, stopped me from eating my favorite pickles because he just read an online article titled “Nitrite is More Poisonous than Arsenic” and was made to believe that pickles are rich with nitrite. Feeling curious, I decided to test and measure the nitrite level in pickles, fresh vegetable and leftovers by myself. I compared my data with the maximum nitrite level intake recommended by our National Food Safety Foundation, and reached a conclusion that we could continue eating pickles but better throw away leftovers. And this makes me realize the gap between science and daily life. Although it is true that lots of food safety journal and articles are published and released every year, average people do not read them because they were specifically written for scientists and professionals. I’m hoping to present these scientific results via animations so that more people can get to know this information. As a Chinese saying goes, “Food is heaven to people,” which could be interpreted as “Food is the most enjoyable thing to people.” I want to do my part to ensure food safety and help people to enjoy their food more.Before researching CALS, I was worried that the academic major I would select might be too specific for most undergraduate programs in the United States. The sentence “CALS selects students who are ready to dive into their major as soon as they set foot on campus” on CALS website immediately eased my worries with the excitement to apply. As a hands-on student who enjoys lab work more than anything else, CALS provides the best undergraduate research opportunity in the states. As someone who is not satisfied with just observing the experiment results, but loves communicating scientific conclusions to others, I think CALS totally aligns with my interest since it values Knowledge with Pubic Purpose. Also, during my school research, I am excited to learn about the research area associate professor Dr. Gavin Sacks focuses on, effects of pre- and post-harvest factors on the organoleptic properties of agricultural products, particularly wines and juices. What a coincidence! Two of my favorite foods are fruits and pickled vegetables. Fruit is the basic ingredient for wines and juices, and both pickled vegetable and wines have to go through the process of fermentation. Since Dr. Sacks is regular participant at winemaking workshops and industry technical conferences, I believe his class will be filled with real life experience and fun!I am very clear about my academic interest and believe CALS is a perfect match to provide the exact research opportunity and educational resource I need to explore food science."

    "CommonApp": "Jumping jacks, high knees, and stretching, I carefully followed the instruction shown on my cellphone. I took a look at my previous record, took a deep breath, and told myself today was the day I shall break my record for twelve kilometers (fifty-five minutes). I started running five years ago with no coach, no stamina, and not even a pair of running shoes. Since running was such a basic human movement, I thought if I carefully controlled my speed, I could run for half an hour. I could not be more wrong. Within 5 minutes, I was totally out of breath.The only thing that propelled me to keep moving my feet was my fear of being unhealthy and overweight, the way I had been throughout middle school. When I first started, I was an overweight kid who could lie on the sofa playing with my iPad without even moving a little for the whole day. I was so lazy that I rely on take-out for a whole week and would need to Uber just to get to the Burger King five minutes away. To be honest, I chose to run because it was the only sport I knew how to do. It wasn’t until much later I realized only few could really master running. For the first several months, every piece of my body hurt when I ran. It was not just my feet, ankles, and knees, but also my arms, back, and even stomach. Running under the sun during the summer was like hell to me. To spare the pain of running, I would think of the most ridiculous reason not to run (rain, wet path, no cold beverage at home, etc.). But I knew if I skip once, I would fall back into the old me that I was so desperate to run away from. I kept running. After more than six months, I could felt the changes inside of me. Pants became loosen. I even need a belt. Potato chips and instant noodles were gone. A lot of green had entered my diet. No more Pepsi or bubble milk tea, just water. Running made me felt more energetic. I was able to concentrate better in school and my grades were improving. I even tried out badminton and soccer, those intensive sports I never dare to try. Everyone can run, but only few can master it. Through continuous training, a runner is making small improvement day by day, week by week, and month by month. None of the improvement is obvious and inspiring. But as long as I stay patient and determined, all my hard work would add up to create fundamental changes. Running not only made me healthier and more outgoing, it also taught me to be patient and trust the all my hard work would pay off. Because of my passion towards debating, I have the tendency to speak really fast. My friends and families were often impressed by how fast I could speak, but often confused about what I was saying. It takes a habit to break a habit. Reading newspaper slowly and out loud became my new nightly habit. I also recorded all of my presentation and debating, trying to fight out where I could improve to make myself clearer. Just like being lazy, speaking too fast takes a lot of time to correct. But as long as I am a little bit better than I was yesterday, I believe I would eventually correct my habit. “12 KM complete. Congratulations.” my cell phone application announced. I checked the time: fifty-four minutes fifty-nine second. I smile, knowing that I have improved just a little again.",

Technology allowed me to present colors smoothly and shapes seamlessly. ;The twenty days I spent over the summer at the ESAP Computer Graphic program in University of Pennsylvania revolutionized my understanding of design and technology in a 3D level. Before the program, I could never imagine that starting on a simple 3D cube in Maya, I could create realistic characters with scaring alien-like tentacles, numerous protruding fierce teeth, and realistic chest muscle just like the Na’vi people in Avatar and then efficiently present it on motion graphic. ;In the Tandon School of Engineering, I hope to continue to explore at the combination of art and technology through Integrated Digital Media major. ;Fundamental courses such as Creative Coding and Mobile Application Development can teach me the basic computer coding skills to create interactive user experience and present my work in multiplatform such as web and mobile application. In addition, technique-based courses such as 3D Animation and Digital Photography and Imaging will allow me to enhance 3D modeling skill in Maya and photography skills in aid to create special effect with green screen.Game Design and Development are a perfect stage for me to apply learned knowledge in a step-by-step process. From brainstorming plots to creating characters’ surface texture, I can collaborate with computer technology in a much more intimate way. In the experimental game narratives courses, I can learn to design a truly interactive game experience with not only realistic graphics and attractive plot. ;In addition, NYU’s study aboard programs will allow me to learn about arts and design in places other than New York. The urban design program in London gives me the opportunity to explore designing accurate 3D visualization software to make urban planning more efficient and architectural heritage preservation more easily. The study abroad programs in Paris enriches my experience of video editing, recording ability, and documentary production to present the beautiful global food culture in the form of lights and sounds. ;At NYU, not only I can improve my programming and designing skills, but also I will gain the opportunity to explore New York, London, and Paris to truly study arts and design. ;"

    "CommonApp": "When I was in elementary school, I was obsessed with a video game called Ballance, a game that requires its player to navigate a ball through various obstacles to reach the destination. Unfortunately, I was not a talented gamer and got stuck by this one stage. Curious about the next stage, I went on the Internet to search for a strategy. While I was not able to find any, I discover a way to “cheat” with a binary text editor. I decrypted the game’s kernel files and edited some hexadecimal digits. As a result, I was able to alter the game’s gravity, the ball’s velocity and weight. It was the first time I realized the magic of finding a shortcut. By changing the rules of the game to my advantage, I was able not only get through the game but also understand how the game was designed.Fortunately for me (not so for my parents), I became a better gamer in junior school. Through the power ofthe internet, I was able to play the game Minecraft with players from all over the world. With several other enthusiastic gamers, we dissected the game and learned how data was processed and stored. With several hundred lines of code, we made it more interesting by allowing more possibilities. We even set up our own server for this alternative version of Minecraft that we designed.Computer games were not the only thing I applied my shortcut-finding skill at. After taking computer science courses in high school, I learned to apply a few lines of codes to replace routine work. With the help of merging sort (a type of sorting algorithm), I was able to rearrange seats randomly with three premises, saving my classmates a lot of time from doing it manually. With the help Java and my understanding of the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve, I could generate a review plan to help me memorize vocabularies. Using simple C# language, I helped my teacher to reprogram a downloading software to double its speed.Many believe that finding a shortcut is unethical and that we should not look for shortcuts in life. What they do not understand is that finding a shortcut is not being lazy. In fact, most of the time, it requires a lot of dedication. Observing the existing pattern and understanding the logic behind it are usually the first step. For each subsection of a problem, we think about what to do in each particular condition, creating an “if” statement. Then we consider which part needs to be operated constantly, creating a “loop”. And at least, think about what to do with an exception. Debugging is essentially a continuous process of experimenting, where we keep building and fixing. Only after countless trials and fixing, a shortcut entrenched. Over time, shortcuts no longer work or need to be improved, and we start the process all over again. But this is the beauty of finding a shortcut: observation, innovation, refinement, and perfection.Instead of settling for “the method that usually works”, I would look for “the method that works better”. Having the curiosity to find shortcuts has allowed me to think outside of the box and to try things that others might see as impossible. Whenever I face a problem, I would put myself in the mind of a shortcut developer, trying to come up with a creative solution. While many might argue that shortcut is the same as cheating, I would argue that shortcut is a way to innovate.",

Just like the title of our textbook,\n“Psychology and Life,” psychology explains many situations in life.

I was fascinated by\n“Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman. I learned to analyze various situations using statistical reasoning\ninstead of sometimes-misleading heuristics. For example, I taught my parents not to waver their preference on\ntraveling by airplanes because of a recent accident they saw in the news. They made the judgment by emotion\nand ignored the overall safeness of plane.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tInspired by the book, I, along with some classmates, conducted an experiment about conformity, people’s\ntendency to imitate group’s behaviors.

Most of the classes will be engineering related. Thus, there will be many opportunities for me to learn and develop an efficient workflow and problem-solving skill of game designing. I look forward to working on large projects to get inspiration from other talented students. It will be a great place to enhance my knowledge in both technology and art.

As the design manager, my job was to communicate with staffs and to match task with capable personnel.Between hundreds of photos and articles to work on, we decided to abandon the traditional method of working as a big group. Instead, we would work in pairs to maximize efficiency. I introduced a cloud sharing service that allowed several designers to discuss and work on projects at the same time. Then I collected our works and delivered the draft to other members to check errors. With this method, we finished designing a few days ahead of the deadline. I believe a leader should be innovative and allow each member to maximize his or her talent.However, not everything went smoothly. When we were designing the layout of the yearbook, there was a conflict between the designers and the editors. Our designers objected the original plan of including each club’s photos, because their low resolution would damage the visual quality of the yearbook. After I communicated with them, they agreed to compromise: we shrink the photos and put more introductions. Thus, we hid the flaw of the photos and included more information.While collaborating, we can accommodate members’ situation to form a customized and efficient work solution. Since we have different preference and capability, conflicts are inevitable. However, I appreciated the disagreement within a group because it helps us quickly identify an issue and improved our works once solved.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Engineering Online Destination\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOne of my favorite online destinations is a channel on YouTube called “Kurzgesagt – In A Nutshell.” It is a channel full of scientific- or educational-based animation that explains some common questions on our textbooks, such as the possibility of space elevator and the pros and cons of nuclear energy. I discovered the channel when I was preparing for my geography final exam and found some animated videos that introduced the structure of Earth on this channel. I still remembered the vividly animated graphs of the atmosphere of Earth that impressed me and helped me a lot for the exam. Since then, I became addictive watching these videos to better comprehend the knowledge I learnt from school because these animations are more effective than our textbooks.Not only do I feel satisfied by the depth of the knowledge, but the smooth animation and lively characters also intrigue me. As someone who enjoys coding and designing, I later taught myself simple animation making with these videos as my template. I would download them and observe the patterns frame by frame. Many details were missed when I watched it for the first time, such as twinkling stars in the background. But when I was making an animation, these elements make whole scene polished and balanced.This channel makes science look beautiful. It is a place where I solidify my knowledge and appreciate the animation. I embrace the method of using animations to explain abstract knowledge.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Explain your educational and career interests and why Annenberg is the best match for you.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a future communication major student, I will develop an expressive approach of communication at Annenberg.

All the courses help me produce a proper way of oral, written, and digital communication to diverse audiences or situation. Once I have a comprehensive understanding of communication knowledge, I would like to put it into use in mass media. Many classes are related to mass media, which is my ultimate pursuit of communication. I will learn to apply theoretical knowledge of communication to digital media in advertising.Annenberg will also prepare me for my future career.

    "CommonApp": "“Look at your sister!” This has been the tagline of my childhood. I grew up constantly looking at an improved reflection of myself. I’m a twin, an identical one at that. I grew up attending the same schools, activities, and groups as my sister; essentially, we shared the same life. And my parents were always in the background, constantly telling me to be more like my sister.This is not to say that being a twin didn’t have its advantages. I had a friend and confidant at all times. It meant that, in a country of only siblings, I was pretty unique, despite having a stunt double. It meant that, when we got in trouble in the classroom, confused teachers would simply threaten both of us. Yet, for each advantage, I encountered difficulties.Unlike my sister, I was born left-handed. It’s not like I chose to be this way; it just happened. But, to my parents, this was unacceptable. When they’d see me doing homework with the opposite hand, they’d grab my pen and give me the usual line: “Look at your sister!” So was I the strange one? I asked my parents why I couldn’t write with my preferred hand; I asked them why I couldn’t be different.“Of course you can be different. But, I mean, how different can you actually be?”I lost my courage to argue any more. I began to believe that as a twin, being identical to my sister was not an advantage, but an obligation. I no longer rejected when I was forced to use the wrong hand, even when the pen slipped out of my weak right fingers again and again. Having a twin was not only a problem at home. Of course, the struggle followed me to school, where my classmates enjoyed comparing the two of us. They compared our grades, sports and even our dances at the school performance. Over and over, it seemed like she came out on top.It might sound odd, but everything changed one day when I chose to wear a blue hairpin to school. I laughed happily at the mirror as I looked at myself next to my sister; she had on a pink hairpin. Of course, we were still together: going to school together, coming home together, doing homework together. But at least I had something to separate myself, some means to construct my own identity. And the blue hairpin was only the beginning. From that moment on, I sought to define myself as someone more than a twin.When we got to tenth grade, my sister and I were separated into different schools, and, in the next few years, I began to notice more qualities that separated the two of us. I realized that, while I loved reading and would lose myself in a novel, my sister couldn’t focus on a story for more than fifteen minutes. I’d look up from a book and find her staring at me wide-eyed: “You’ve been reading for three hours…” So? I thought to myself. Could this be jealousy? In the past, I would have traded my interest in literature for her skill in art; perhaps, my sister was thinking the exact opposite the whole time.Look at your sister. I used to think this phrase was always directed at me, an admonishment that suggested inferiority. Now I know this is not the case. While my sister has never mentioned it, I’m sure she’s felt the same resentment towards these comparisons. After all, we may look the same, but, underneath, we have radically different identities. I don’t need everyone else to see this; all that matter is I know it to be true.",

Of course, UND is a well-known religious community, and I look forward to meeting students who have radically different background, both cultural and religious. ;I’m also excited to be part of UND’s public service community. I understand that a vast majority of Notre Dame students perform social services as undergraduates and a large contingent go on to volunteer work after graduation. I believe this reveals not only the University’s focus on a moral education; it shows UND’s practicality. I think, for our society to endure through troubling times, it’s important that people entering the workforce bear a moral responsibility. After all, an education at Notre Dame would be wasted if graduates simply sought their own success after college, rather than the success of people around them. ;I believe that UND would be the perfect place for religious studies and the best school to pursue a life of service. I believe Notre Dame will help me fulfill these two immense goals.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Home is where your story begins.

I mean this in the most positive way.I used to believe in everything. Unfortunately, my parents liked to trick me. My father would give me cold medicine and say it was candy; my mother told me that if I didn’t eat mushroom, I would be turned into a witch.At first, I hated those lies. I was too young to realize they were benefiting me. Once I was old enough, I recognized that morality is nuanced. While many of us assume that any lie is reprehensible, it’s not that clear-cut. My judgments should not be simply led by my common perceptions toward phenomena. ;My experience with my parents led me to be a non-traditionalist and an enduring skeptic. I might criticize a popular film that everyone seems to love. I will push back on the common belief in China that all religion is dangerous. I will search for the truth behind each and every claim. ;My home inspired me to doubt, and to establish my own opinion."

    "CommonApp": "I’ve always felt that yoga was my past-life partner. At nine years old, as my classmates ran to ballet and its bright pink tutus, I strolled right to yoga classes and its free form garb. Three years ago everything changed when my teacher started doing handstands in class. I cannot do an inversion. It would seem that for each attempt, no matter how supplemented with support walls, instructional videos, and sheer force of will, there is always the falling action and the collapse back down to the mat. So why is it that I fail? Why can’t I get it right? The short answer is that I do not know or I could do it, on the other hand, in the spirit of personal exploration I shall present to you some hypothesizes for my failure. The first problem was always courage. I’d get up against the wall. Center my mind, fight against the strain in my arms and… I’d stay still. I didn’t want to fall. I couldn’t take the risk to push away and trust my body to hold me in the air.  The same thing happened to me last year. I went to a place where people went bungee jumping, and then to my complete dissatisfaction I watched my friend take a plunge into the abyss from the side—too scared to jump myself.  He was fine of course, better than fine, his beaming face and wind blown hair testament to the thrill of the plunge. So why can’t I push off the wall? Why didn’t I bungee jump? After this instance I made myself let go more, relishing the collapse to reality as part of the rise and fall of my own life. You can bet that if I get another chance to bungee jump I’m not going to stay pressed up the wall again. The second problem might not be of strength or courage but instead the tranquility and calm required for a handstand. Did you know I love coffee! My favorite word is tretar, a Swedish word that means the action of asking for a second cup of coffee. I tretar a lot. Maybe too much. I love how this bitter dark drink invigorates my mind and accompanies a long day in the library or a small café with a book or a project. I can see myself at university sitting with my friends and discussing work over coffee—teaching them the true meaning of tretar. And yet, perhaps tretar is one of the problems with my handstands. Energy is important, and its something I definitely don’t lack, however quiet and focused resolve is too. So maybe to rise into a perfect handstand I need both the braveness to push off but also the patience to reach for and develop superior balance. Finally, there exists the problem of persistence. I’ve been trying this for three years, but maybe in relative terms that’s not too long but too short? My father named me after his favorite Ming Dynasty emperor with the hope that like my namesake, I would have the air of effortless success. But, what if this name encourages me to merely imagine that I have the ability without putting the work in? The life of a normal person requires one to get messy and sweaty and to fail over and over before attaining success. Maybe I’ll succeed next year and then even this essay is part of the road to achieving my goal.So far, I’ve failed every time I’ve tried but I’m going to keep going. I learn from my failure and improve myself time after time. It is the hardest things that are worth achieving and I’m so excited to keep failing and learning in the pursuit of one day standing on my hands.",

However, it wasn’t until I saw ND’s award-winning “What Would You Fight For?” series that I realized ND is the one, the only one.In my childhood, I loved superman movies. I aspired to be a superman (superperson!), fighting for the human race and conquering evil. As I have grown older, the concern for those, left behind in my country’s rise to economic success, who are stuck in economic and environment poverty wring my heart. I hope to use my educational privilege and human power to create a better living environment for them. I have watched every video in the series. These two-minute segments demonstrate the deep and abiding benevolence in every member of the ND family. Equipped with knowledge and abilities learnt from school, they integrated their life with social concerns. I believe this is the essence of education, and only ND achieves that. I can’t imagine how lucky I would be to have the ND family stand at my side as we fight together for what really matters. ;"

    "CommonApp": "When I first arrived at Duke, the American life was the same as I had always imagined: people ate hamburgers, spent their free time playing sports and religiously used Instagram to capture and share every moment of their lives. While all these were familiar scenes to me, a fan of American movies and TV series, I still found myself out of place. I’m accustomed to drinking hot, boiled water, but my American counterparts relished in icy cold drinks. In back of my mind, I heard my mom quietly reminding me, \"When in America, do as Americans do!\" Since this was my first trip abroad alone, my mom was anxious about everything. I remember calming her down before taking my flight, reminding her that I had logged in more than 10,000 hours of watching American TV shows and that in Malcolm Gladwell's words, I'd be an expert of American culture! I immediately began to feel a growing tension between my deeply rooted and instinctive \"Chinese-ness\" and my conscious effort to be American.Trying my best to fit into American college life, I began to do what others sometimes accuse we Chinese people of doing quite well: copycatting. If a psychiatrist were to diagnose me and my actions, he or she would find the whole thing quite ironic; in order to adopt another cultural identity, I was invoking one of Chinese people's key traits: conformity. To help me fulfill my mission to become more American by the day, I decided to get help from few of my classmates who were Chinese Americans. They took me shopping at a nearby mall and helped me buy \"cool\" t-shirts with spunky and at times politically incorrect messages. During breakfast, they trained me how to cut, toast and spread cream cheese on this thing that looked much less exciting than a donut called a bagel.While I was obsessed with shedding my Chinese-ness, my Cultural Anthropology class was all about being cognizant of and respecting how different cultures develop over time and through unique circumstances that surround them. My professor, who was an African American lady, seemed inspiring as she exuded genuine enthusiasm and appreciation for her own culture despite the painful history and realities of racism and slavery. In direct contrast with my attitude, she never shied away from her own identity. Instead she proudly introduced different genres of rap music and African American communities' long and honorable march towards more civil rights and liberties. I even noticed that one pair of her earrings was a silhouette of Africa. Her confidence and love for her own culture made her look radiant.That night, lying on bed feeling restless, I asked myself, \"If one doesn't respect his or her own culture, why should others respect that person's culture?\" Abandoning my own culture automatically deprived others’ chances in knowing the real me. The goal of spending three weeks in America wasn't just a one way street of me absorbing all that is American, but a two way street where I also add to its famous melting-pot diversity and share with them what I love about my own culture.After the introspection, I began to dress-up in the traditional costumes that I had brought with me, curl up my hair with chopsticks and make dumplings for my classmates. I no longer avoided talking about China and felt awkward when my classmates asked politically incorrect things about my country. Instead, I mustered up the courage to use whatever English communication skills I had gathered over the years to calmly articulate my points and contribute to class discussions. For example, I felt elated when my professor became passionate explaining different dialects in America after I had introduced different dialects in China to the class.The rewarding experience taught me the importance of accepting my own culture in order to appreciate other cultures and allow others to appreciate my own.",

The current reality is evolving in a manner that Huxley had foreseen in 1931. Most of us believe that we are free from domination and oppression. But are we really free? Nowadays, we yield to the sweet pleasure and convenience brought by technology and no longer have the energy to think critically. Moreover, the rapidly emerging materialism which emphasizes quantifiable measurements of happiness and human worth may erode our humanistic values.To fight against Huxley’s world from becoming our own, we have to resist our instinct to categorize people and their worth especially based on traits we can't control. The underlying themes in the book have real significance and arouse my thinking. That’s why it’s my favorite book."

    "CommonApp": "I walked onto the stage.In front of me were over five hundred unfamiliar faces. I could hear my pulse pounding in my temples. I had been waiting for and dreading this moment for a while, and my brain was humming with tension and excitement. My right hand was firmly gripping the microphone like a pale starfish: “Hi everyone, my name is Lancer Li and I am an exchange student from China. I want to introduce to you a service program called Bilingual Reading Project…”I gave two speeches to the entire school during the third month of my exchange program. I was trembling the entire time. Being a newcomer is more intimidating than I thought–every day, not only did I try to hold onto the few friendships I had managed to establish, but I strived to appear at ease. I hated to be seen as different, as an outsider. But my label “exchange student” meant that I would leave soon, and the impact I could have on the school society would be far more limited than everyone else. So, what about going onto the school stage and promoting a program I started, managed and put tremendous effort into? What about leading a team of people I didn’t know at all? I wrestled with those ideas for weeks before I summoned my courage to walk into the principal’s office and give Dr. Moran my project proposal–thankfully, my preconceived fears didn’t stop me.Students and teachers started sending me emails and talking to me in the hallway, expressing their interests in participating in the program and helping blind children in China, or simply encouraging me to work harder and be a “man for others.” I was overwhelmed with love and joy, and more excitingly, I managed to put together a team of over thirty American students, who would record the English version of the bilingual literatures.Leading a team of many freshmen and seniors, however, can be quite challenging. Several freshmen happily signed up and never showed up again, while seniors, suffering from potent “senioritis” in the last months of high school, simply did not care much. I spent days discussing with teachers and trying to motivate my teammates. I published a story in the school newspaper, the Prep News. I also cooperated with Campus Ministry pastoral teams by telling them how much blind children in China loved reading and craved learning English, and what Bilingual Reading Project meant to both them and me.Nothing was more frustrating than receiving an email from a participant on a due date, saying that he needed another week for the recordings. However, nothing energized me more than completing the audio recordings of the stories of The Little Mermaid or Pride and Prejudice with my new American friends. The result of introducing Bilingual Reading Project to St. Louis University High School was more than delightful. I collected numerous valuable recordings for the program. I cherished my nerve-wracking public speaking experience and became much more confident in later student-led discussions. I joined the Prep News and the school pastoral team, where I met some of my best friends. I felt, for the first time, that I belonged to the school society.Looking back, my first decision to go on the stage generated so much momentum for me to overcome new challenges.As I was visiting Nanjing School for the Blind after going back to China, Yuxiao, the Director of Student Life, told me teachers and students truly appreciated the new series with the authentic American voices. Meanwhile, the number of Bilingual Reading’s online listeners skyrocketed–from four thousand to over fifteen thousand. I was able to help many more online English learners in mainland China.I was happy and grateful that I took the initiative, assumed my leadership role and persisted, and that I encountered so many loving souls who encouraged me to walk further with determination.",

I was the lab rat, the first Chinese international student. St. Louis became my home.Living on a different continent–8300 miles from parents–is hard. Thankfully, living and growing in St. Louis has been a true blessing. ;I stayed with a loving host family of African American and Native American heritages, a family that supported me spiritually, educated me on modern day racism and embedded in my heart the seeds of political activism. ;Learning from SLUH art teachers and visiting Sam Fox School studios at Washington University in St. Louis complemented my experience in Chinese art classrooms and offered me more flexible, open-ended perspectives in my artistic interpretations of the reality.Living far away from parents helped me reflect on my family relationship. Had I not chosen to live so far from my hometown, I would never have missed my grandmother’s fried dumplings so dearly or learned to appreciate every simple road trip with my father.These two years in St. Louis transformed me. I became more independent, reflective and grateful."

    "Supps": "题目：College of Arts and Sciences - What work of art, music, science, mathematics, or literature has surprised, unsettled, or challenged you, and in what way?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I remember putting down the book in tears, trembling to gather my thoughts.In The Secret Scripture, Sebastian Barry, in the most poetic language, fiercely snatched my heart to the most violent age of the Irish upheaval, to the remotest, bleakest corner of a unknown mount, where, Roseanne Clear, a beautiful Irish Protestant woman, endured for decades the hatred from a prejudiced society for her nonexistent marriage infidelity.Throughout the book, numerous people suffered from the alienation from the society, yet only one, Dr. Grene, spontaneously attached himself to the social margin for the salvation of Roseanne’s dignity.The memories of being bullied immediately flashed back to me, when for two years I was taunted for my girlish handwriting. When the boys called me sissy and elbowed me during distance running, I used to get mad; why wasn’t there a Dr. Grene standing behind me? ;But now I wonder, why not me? Why should I NOT suffer? A life free of alienation and wounds seems perfectly desirable, but meanwhile, this mentality occur to me as both unrealistic and arrogant; as millions, around the world, down the history, have lived or are living Roseanne’s tragedies, should I mourn over my temporary difficulties, or should I become a Dr. Grene, standing more a less privileged soul?Lives exist in parallels. We hurt and get hurt, but we would always expect a Dr. Grene in our dark times, justifying all our claims with the most soothing tone and the most careful reasonings. ;Roseanne’s tears was cold after ages of solitude. My tears were still burning hot in my cheeks.Suffering is inevitable and the desired miracle didn’t happen to me, or it just never would. ;But I can still look out for Roseannes.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：We are a community with quirks, both in language and in traditions.

I can draw on anything, scratch paper (obviously), napkins, free commercial handouts and even my own hands. However, the subject of drawing never changes: always simple portraits.I can trace this habit back to my third grade studio art practice, when my mentor taught me the drawing of human face with just a few lines. The simplicity of such tiny portraits fascinated me, who at the time was still struggling with simple geometric models. I immediately started experimenting with my own portraits, whenever I can, wherever I can.By the time I finished the pretzels, one side my napkin had already been decorated with quick portraits of a baby and an old man. ;I put down my pen and pressed the overhead button to summon the air attendant. ;“Hmmm, can I have some more napkins?”"

    "CommonApp": "A strange yet recurring feeling kept striking me, when I stopped the final gas chromatography analysis, when I finished calculating the conversion rate of the reactant, and when I typed in the last word of my research report. “Do not stop here, you’re doing the right thing”, and I followed it, spontaneously. Those moments gradually made me aware of the very thing I would take as a lifelong endeavor—chemistry and research. The summer of 2016 marked the beginning of my research career. Taking part in Dongrun-Yau Science Award (Chemistry) contest was a decision without hesitation, and such a rewarding experience brought me a summer brimmed with the pungency of chemicals and the sweetness of accomplishment. With two friends also dedicated to chemistry, I sought to bring a brand new and effective method of catalyst synthesis—atomic layer deposition—to an existing reaction—selective conversion of furfural to cyclopentanone. Various problems emerged the moment we set about conducting the experiment, namely lack of equipment, operation failures and coordination difficulties. I could still recall how afraid of being rejected I was when persuading a professor in Nanjing University into offering unfamiliar and inexperienced high school students the access to an autoclave, toxic nanoparticles, high pressure gas and a gas chromatograph in his laboratory. At first, contrary to what I had expected—simply adding the reactant and catalyst into an autoclave and pumping hydrogen, there were countless essential operation details I had neglected. It was then that I started perusing previous studies in search of those details and reaction conditions, by which I surprisingly gained a general sense of how to write academic papers. The next week was filled with preparation work, during which my partners even claimed to have seen my excitement through the sparkles in my eyes. Nevertheless, the pivotal part of the experiment was never smooth, either. Unsatisfactory results, ensuing quarrels, and a separation when we each went to summer schools all added to the difficulty. At Cornell University Summer College, checking their progress was my first task in the morning and I even hoped to set the apparatus through my phone screen or dig a hole on the ground to travel back and forth. Finally done with the experiments, I also struggled to finish our research report, trying to be precise with word selection, strict with the format of reference...Three months is way too short a period to figure out each reason behind the results, and plenty of questions were left for further study, for which I am really anxious. The sense of fulfillment after completing this project was unprecedented, but chemistry has permeated my life long before 9th grade, the first year of my chemistry curriculum. The first time I saw my father, a professor of environmental engineering, doing experiments on sewage purification, I was amazed at how things could undergo such intangible yet drastic changes. I followed his graduate students to study the remediation of nitrate pollution in groundwater using fuel cells in 7th grade, during which I got the first taste of ions, galvanic cells, redox reactions, etc. Watching others doing experiments tempted me to conduct simple experiments in person. With a general sense of Vitamin C as an antioxidant and potassium permanganate an oxidizing agent, I grouped four classmates to compare the Vitamin C content in various vegetables in 8th grade. A year later, I collected samples of calcium carbonate, including eggshell, pearl powder and fishbone, to study the temperature at which thermal decomposition occurs for each sample. In addition, I have been following online chemistry courses on Coursera and Khan Academy, exploring many aspects of chemistry, including but not limited to inorganic, organic and physical. With a strong aspiration for scientific research, I earnestly look forward to more theoretical backup, experiments, and industrial experience in college, to help me realize the goal of making a difference to pharmaceuticals, health and conservation.",

Why will Cornell's College of Arts and Sciences be the right environment in which to pursue your interests?

Enchanted by the spellbinding changes in color and light, I started hands-on experiments in middle school. Unlike my peers, who started chemistry by memorizing chemical equations, I started with a comprehensive knowledge of basic principles, e.g., atomic structure, states of matter, and thermodynamics by watching videos on Khan Academy. I have always been proud of such overall understanding that helped me sail through chemistry problems in the following years. I love doing research, verifying my own hypotheses by self-designed experiments, and I am always excited about studying new theories. As my oldest friend, chemistry has offered me a feast for the eyes, the joy of success, the sweetness of overcoming setbacks, and the gratification of curiosity. ;Just as I am amazed by the light and heat emitted in chemical reactions, I marvel at how single notes make up pieces with great momentum. Just as I love stirring solutions with glass rods, I enjoy roaming around the keys. The piano led my way to the realm of classical music. I could recall how ecstatic I was when I was able to proceed to pieces of Chopin, Liszt and Debussy, knowing that all the pain of practising The Virtuoso Pianist in 60 Exercises and the Czerny etudes has paid off. I started to find the patterns of contemporary works, forming a general idea of style and genre through The Introduction to Classical Music on Coursera. Beginning with Ravel's La Valse, I started to enjoy works of Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff and Ravel not only for pleasure, but also for the harmony and orchestration. Instead of simply listening, I long for a professional perspective to better appreciate the techniques musicians used to impress me. ;However, I encountered difficulties when learning atomic structure. Without the knowledge of quantum physics and calculus, I could hardly understand orbitals and wave functions. I realized that the blurring boundaries among science disciplines make it difficult to achieve expertise in one field without knowledge in others. Besides, only universities specializing in music provide great courses in music in China. Therefore, I started looking for a US liberal arts education, seeking math and physics backup before specialization in chemistry, and a systematic education in music. ;My college research began with browsing the graduation requirements. Attracted by the rigor and flexibility of the chemistry major, the freedom to choose minors, and the distribution, breadth, writing and foreign language skills the courses provide, I applied for Cornell University Summer College to take a closer look at the College of Arts and Sciences and Cornell. While eating in RPCC, taking TCAT buses, studying in Olin Library till eight and walking back to Mary Donlon left an indelible impression on me, I was more fascinated by the music performance given by Wayne Lee and Mike Cheng-Yu Lee, and the rigorous course work. Unfamiliar with medical terminology, I had a hard time with my veterinary medicine course, but I received help from my lecturers, TA, and RCA, helping me bring my potential into full play—I was quite satisfied with my quizzes and final grades! The three-week miniature of college life and an Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Admissions Information Session in Klarman Hall prompted me to apply to Cornell. ;In College of Arts and Sciences, I hope to make full use of math and physics courses to prepare myself for advanced chemistry courses and honors based on independent research, and I wish to indulge myself in Lincoln Hall, to find the right people to talk about classical music. With an international background and eager to promote living conditions globally, I never regard the distribution, foreign language, writing and breadth requirements as a burden, but my once in a lifetime opportunities to gain a knowledge of the social and cultural background in certain areas to make contributions to conservation and health there."

He was still sitting in the darkness of the ramshackle attic, staring at the direction his mother left, his gray eyes emotionless.\" I finished typing the last word, mumbling to myself, \"Such a sorrowful theme! Next time, I should try something more optimistic.\"Historical Wuxia (Martial arts hero) novels enthralled me six years ago. While reading works by Jin Yong, a famous Chinese writer, I was awed by his intricately constructed plots that subtly hid a subtext insinuating criticism of the Chinese society. Since then, I have started reading diverse genres of novels, including historical accounts, science fiction, and Chinese Kung-Fu series. It is my entertainment and a way to break from the reality. More importantly, it opens a portal to a society beyond my student’s world.My first attempt at writing Wuxia novel was nothing more than a personal anecdote. When I shared my work, everybody seemed to dislike the idea of me writing novels. Unlike classical novels, Wuxia novels are generally viewed as distractions by the Chinese educational elites. One day, my teacher asked me for a private meeting to say:\"Why do you waste your time on novels? Read something more appropriate like dramas and poems.\"\"But just like plays or poems, novels can portray different emotions, thoughts, and values!\"Both my teacher and I were stunned by how loud and fast I responded to his question. As a result, I had to stand in his office for an entire morning.However, despite all these, my passion for writing novels did not diminish. I continued to write novels, as short as 30 words or as long as 120,000 words, whenever I felt an impulsive need to depict stories bubbling in my mind. Gradually, I engaged myself in the writing techniques, plot devices and the malleability of the Chinese language anchored in the pictographic script, which I could not have experienced in a classroom. Writing has built for me a mental palace where I felt the complete freedom to architect every single detail and set my imagination free to roam. In this little world of authorship, everything came alive to my beckoning.I feel strongly that although I had only one identity in the real world, I could experience different lives through my pen. From the insidious thoughts of criminals to the inner struggles of tragic heroes, I laughed and cried together with these characters. In the process, my emotions were further developed from the exploration of the variety of characters to the much-needed observations of daily life. I indeed use novels as the portal that connects me with the much more diverse thoughts and experience. As a young boy, I was fairly introverted, but my passion for writing has engaged me with the surrounding world. Now I have come to realize that my written works should be dedicated to the readers instead of being an egocentric endeavor--- it is not a selfish art. Last week, my secondary school teacher asked me for the latest chapter of my novel. Just as proudly, he told me that his favorite pastime now is reading novels by his former student.",

This was totally unbelievable to me, who have lived only with Chinese for the past 14 years of my life.Indeed, my days in Singapore were filled with Indian Prata, Singapore’s eclectic Laksa, and the curious Japanese pastries, to name a few. I celebrated Christmas, Vesak Day, Eid and Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival. In evenings, I spent hours telling stories about the Ming Dynasty and the origin of the Great Wall to my Singaporean friends and learned from them the meaning of the slang \"Kiasu\". I did not feel foreign in Singapore but instead felt genuinely welcomed by this diverse mix of nationalities, gender identities and backgrounds. From my experience in China where we are often placed in schools with similar ‘types’ of students, I realized how diversity encourages even more dialogue and exploration.As much as most people treat this as the new ‘norm’, I continue to be amazed with a kind of childish wonder with this world I am discovering. Maybe it is because of the city I grew up in, but I intend to make the most of all this amazing diversity I encounter, be part of it and also promote it, no matter where I go. I truly appreciate this is how the life should be celebrated, in all its many colors, types, interests, background and loves."

    "CommonApp": "I wanted my PowerPoint presentation for children at Dyslexic Association Singapore to be a blockbuster.Selecting a beautiful typeface was critical. Helvetica or Time New Roman? Too banal. Probably, the loops and squiggles of Snell Roundhand would impress the dyslexic children. 10 years ago I made a similar choice when start writing Chinese calligraphy. I fell for the cursive strokes of the running script. I know writing the beautiful running script would allow me to stand out from most beginners who practiced the regular script, which I thought was too commonplace. Nevertheless, standing beside my PPT slides, I experienced freezing coldness despite the glazing sun shining into the classroom through the windowpane. I instructed the students on basic addition, but when I asked if anyone could answer the sample question with word description, deafening silence enveloped me. Some stared at me with bewilderment, some were dozing. They had dyslexia. They often saw the mirror images of letters. They needed time. I kept reminding myself not to lose my temper. I raised my voice to explain every step slowly for a second time, and a third time until my voice became hoarse.Still no response. My hope died off in the scorching heat and stuffy humidity in the air, like an orchid wilting at the window.I proposed a break to pause the embarrassment, squatted at the corner and buried my face in the arms. Suddenly, I sensed a gentle poke on my arm. A little boy stood beside me. I recognised him as the boy in the front row who kept turning around.\"Could you understand what I taught?\" I looked for an answer.He nodded his head, blinking with his big innocent eyes.\"Could you do the sample question?\" I asked, patting his head gently.I caught his hesitance. His head  lowered down slightly, but turned left and right thereafter to indicate a \"no\" answer.\"The words on the slides were not clear…\"How to make the words clearer? I shuddered. I did not want to believe it, but it might be the problem of Snell Roundhand. I retrieved my laptop and tried a few other typefaces: the cool SansBlack, the nifty Chalkboard and the formal Georgia, but his eyes moved up and down. However, when it came to Helvetica, his eyes brightened.I was surprised at his choice, but thinking about it for a second time, I realized my design concept was entirely wrong. The decorative and ornate strokes of Roundhand looked beautiful to me, but only confused them. Lacking the capability to read easily, the dyslexic children needed the typeface to be clear and simple, like Helvetica.One is like one's typeface. I assumed Snell Roundhand and running script in calligraphy to be appealing, but they were in fact flamboyant acts of an attention seeker. I forgot that the foremost function of typeface in a design was to effectively convey the messages to the target audience.On the other hand, Helvetica exists to deliver ideas without dominating over the content, directing the passengers in the subway station, or displaying information on various digital device. Its omnipresence often makes us forget its presence, but it elegantly allows the readers to focus on the content. A few weeks later, when I was drafting a design of notebook covers for the Big Bridge Academy Bookstore, the image of dyslexic children appeared in mind, and my attention naturally fell on Helvetica. I started to embrace it. It symbolizes getting rid of anything superfluous and reminds me to stay focused on the most central issue. No longer am I obsessed with pursuing specialness for the sake of it, and Helvetica's minimalism is a way of being special. I want to live and do things as simple and clear as Helvetica.",

Developing a model for satellite distribution around Earth during Singapore International Mathematical Challenge, I saw the indispensability of programming in math modelling; Intrigued by shapes of protein molecules, like alpha helix or beta pleated sheet, I started to learn about computational chemistry, which requires an in-depth understanding of computer sciences and quantum physics. Thus, acquiring knowledge in different sciences from Mudd's Core, especially through courses like the Core Lab, can best satiate my intellectual thirst.Moreover, training in HSA allows me to be a critical thinker understanding the impact of sciences on the society. In Knowledge&Inquiry, I read about Milgram's controversial psychological experiment, and started pondering questions like \"Do we have free will or are we controlled by the authority?\" and \"What is the moral boundary of scientific experiments?\" Learning various schools of thoughts in morality, from the virtue theory to deontology to utilitarianism,  ;I realize that no single theory is perfect, but we should debater over such problems rather than remain silent. Hence, I look forward to investigate the interrelation between sciences and human actions through  ;courses like PHIL179B and STS010.Mudd also turns theoretical training into practical use with its very special clinical program. Math Department's past program with Walt Disney Animation Studio to extract information from the tools' data excites me. The mere mention of the Disney attracts a girl obsessed with cartoons since childhood, not to say working for it. I also remember during Project Work, my team made use of data collected from participants to analyze the impact cellphone use on human interaction. In the process of applying statical skills, we learnt of knowledge not covered in textbooks like the chi-squared test. Hence, the clinical program equips me with skills to transform the matrices and numbers into lenses to view real-life problems, and practice further enhances learning.Apart from the academics, the people in Mudd would also make my college life meaningful. Professor Arthur Benjamin's commitment in spreading the beauty of mathematics to wider audience tells me that teachers here really aspire to be impactful. My years in Math Appreciation Club were dedicated to similar efforts. Using mathematics to fix Rubik's cubes or drawing comics to teach math theories happened constantly to engage the student population. The relationship between us and our audience was reciprocal: as we searched for the best communicate strategy, we improved our own understanding. Thus, Professor Benjamin is my role model, inspiring me to continue reaching out to others my drawing of math comics, and helping with Homework Hotline.Therefore, I look forward to being a Mudder, who can not only reason and research, but also critique and communicate."

    "CommonApp": "I shuffled toward the dock and stood still at the edge, clenching my fists and reassuring myself it was just a jump. The Brave Dive, YMCA's tradition that requires campers to plunge into the cold sea to greet the new day, had come to my turn. I looked back but only saw the challengers who jumped ahead of me dripping wet and shivering in the wind. Their faces went pale; lips became blue; teeth chattered with coldness. Looking at the rippleless muddy water again, I deemed it as a howling abyss which kept terrifying me not to venture a step further or it would devour me. I hesitated and then flinched, standing there like a coward penguin.Vivid memories of how I cowered likewise when being told my plan of making a pollutant-testing machine was merely a fantasy flooded me. \"I'm gonna make a portable machine that can test pollutant components in the sewage.\" Claimed I excitedly, \"Then the Treatment Plant can make targeted solutions and dispose the sewage more efficiently while cost less.\" Nevertheless, the crowd kept convincing me of being humble instead of supporting me, \"Don't be silly. You barely know the operating principle of a pollutant tester. Let alone to make one.\" Their harsh words punched me heavily and did make me hesitate. Was I going beyond my depth in inventing that machine? I preconceived the potential challenges—no funding; no technical assistance; no working time—on my mind over and over again, beginning to mistrust and fear for my ambition. What if I still fail after sparing every effort?I vacillated, as I am now doing at this edge, balking and dreading to step further. \"Jimmy, now!\" My counselor shouted and dragged me out of my memory. At the moment of mind blanking, I jumped into the sea. The frigid water surrounded me immediately; however, I wasn't paralyzed by the coldness as I thought. Instead, my muscles adapted to the temperature quickly and I was able to come up for air.The feeling of resurrection fulfilled my heart. The joy enabled me to recall the struggling experience. When lingering around the line between giving up and putting up, I read Roosevelt's speech and was impressed by “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\". I was haunted by the fear of failure all the time before starting my Pollutant tester project; like on the dock I kept telling myself not to jump because I might not finish the dive perfectly as those boys. Whereas, it wasn't only good outcomes or honors meant; it was also how we strived and dared to conquer the challenges.Outcomes satisfy others; processes enriched doers themselves. Figuring these out, I started my project along with other three friends two years ago, blanking my mind as I dive into the ocean at this moment. Being challenged all the time but never compromised, we fought persistently against the setbacks inside and outside. In the countless revisions for design drawings and exhausting experiments for tester systems, I was rewarded with more professional academic knowledge and solider friendships. Upon completion of the project, I harvested more than a machine, but also courage and confidence.When climbing onto the dock and yelling to the sky, I felt the same satisfaction I had at the moment when I successfully ran our Spectrophotometry Pollutant Tester. I strode to my buddies, with a new sense of pride, a new sense of confidence, and a new sense of courage, for I didn't fail myself nor my dear friends. Looking back, I saw clearly that magnifying fears of the unknown brought nothing but indecisiveness. Instead, taking bold steps to fight enabled me to explore further.

I hope I can make even a subtle difference to the world. NYU tells me I can do more. ;“Challenging with unconventional wisdom in and of the city, and drawing inspiration from its vitality.” NYU fosters continual innovation in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship through a wide variety of offerings both inside and outside the classroom. Distinctive and top-quality education and various research projects in NYU not only enhance students’ knowledge and practical skills, but also broaden students’ scopes and visions. I long to dig up all my potential while rigorously cultivated in NYU. I can learn not only facts but also how to learn and how to think. NYU enables me to improve my project on pollutants, helping me to better treat pollutions and analyze the environment by using advanced mathematics skills.I am keen on Mathematics since I was a little child. All Geometry puzzles in high school textbooks can be settled by five basic Euclidean geometry axioms; complicated results are predicted by analyzing a set of simple data. To a children like me, Mathematics is so amazing. In my view, it broadens man’s vision and enables us to get rid of logical confusions; correlations between various factors can be unified and then updated by Mathematics. Locating in the biggest international financial center, NYU has one of the strongest education quality on mathematics. Numerous elites working in Wall Street indicate the power of math modelling – how it help people analyze and predict. I long to learn math in such great college to serve my community. ;“Ideas are free to exchange; research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish.” NYU tutors, “ Then you can contribute to the betterment of our world.” Diverse and inclusive community carrying on regional, national, and global commitments, NYU ardently pursues his goal of making scholars who are strong, bright, useful, and true. There are packs possessing wisdom, responsibility and excellence here, whose boundless allegiance to its community."

    "CommonApp": "“Why leave me alone in Shanghai?”I always asked my parents on the phone. “You are too young to understand now, but I promise to let you when you are older.”When I was 5, my parents left me to my grandparents and went to work in Beijing. Although we talked over the phone every week and met once in a few months, I had never heard from them the answer I want. “Am I a trouble for my parents?” I sometimes questioned myself. However, when I turned 9, my parents finally brought me to Beijing to live with them. My dream came true. “Milk or soy milk?” My mom would ask me every morning at breakfast. A simple question like this was enough to make me feel happy. But this feeling of happiness deterred me from raising my long-hidden question again as I feared hearing something that might throw me back into the dark old days. In a summer day when I was 12,my parents were out. I started doing chore as usual. As I was organizing the cabinet, I found a letter. Who writes letters in these days? Driven by curiosity, I opened the envelope. A word that was strikingly similar immediately caught my eyes. My name. This letter was supposed to be delivered to me although I had never received it. I read on. Then, I could not move my eyes away from it. It told a sad story. Three months before my parents left for Beijing, they had a road trip to Inner Mongolia with their friends. A bad car crash took place due to an unexpected snowstorm. My father’s best friend was seriously injured. He was disabled for life. My father owed his friend a lot of help during the college years, so he decided to move to Beijing, where his friend lived, to look after him and his aging parents.At night, I told my parents about the letter. After moments of silence and consideration,they decided to be completely honest with me.I found out that they did not send out that letter because they could not decide whether it was in my best interest. They worried that the “truth” would only convince me that they chose their friend over me and thus hurt me more. On the other hand, they were reluctant to lie to me as they thought that the discovery of their lie would eventually cost my trust towards them. It was indeed a dilemma that I was too young to understand when I was only 5. At that time, there was no better alternative for them – it was impossible to take care of their disabled friend and me at the same time. Although their explanation did not eliminate my child shadow overnight, I got to know my parents better - they were actually more responsible and braver than I had thought. I was drawn closer to them because of this realization. In the years that followed, I grew up, gradually stepping out of my parents’ s protection and into the real world. The older I became, the harder for me to say an answer or a decision is right or wrong. When all the possible choices are imperfect, what we decide to do determines what kind of person we are. In a family, a brave and responsible man will try his best to protect his parents and children even if the decision may cost some of the happiness the family members currently possess, while in a society, he will be able to sacrifice the interests of the minority for those of the majority. As the class representative, in order to help the students who cannot keep up with the study, I will not hesitate to ask my teacher to slow down and explain each problem more meticulously. This will certainly affect the efficiency of the top students, but it benefits the others who are more in need of help. The fact that choosing from imperfections is difficult does not mean we should refrain from making decisions. Instead, it is exactly when we should become truly considerate and responsible people.",

I was born on a bright sunny afternoon in 1998. That’s why the character of “sun” is in my name. However, I enjoy reading Vachel Lindsay amid rainstorm: ;Look you, I’ll go pray - ;“Sweet Mary, make me cleanThou rainstorm of the soul,Thou wine from worlds unseen.”Whenever I feel fatigued, the cold rain washes the dust off my soul. ;After the rain comes the sun. In broad daylight, I morph into one of Tagore’s Stray Birds, travelling through the beautiful landscapes inside the “paintings in words”. Poems are my tinted-glasses, through which I observe the phenomenal world of Immanuel Kant, colorful and emotional. When I am angry or sad, poets whisper in my ears, helping me unclench my fists and give me the wings of letting go to explore the vast blue sky. ;I also read poems to sense the experience that I cannot live through. I like Xu Zhimo, a Chinese poet who died in the 1930s, and I read him in Longtang, or neighborhoods circumscribed by alleys, narrow, winding and distinct to Shanghai. In April, raindrops wash the white walls, and melancholy permeates the moist air around me. It is where history and present meet. It is where the poet lived, loved and died. ;But today will unavoidably become yesterday. The maze of longtang will someday be shadowed and replaced by shopping malls and high rises. I read poems to catch the vanishing voice of yesterday, to explore the place I grow up and belong to and to discover my cultural identity. ;Let poem be the unique voice of life. Let me be a good listener, next to Willy’s Statue, under the shade of the luxuriant oaks. I would like to share with other Rice students my imaginations, sentiments and cultural background through poems in occasions like Poetry Slam Night. The Rice residential college, a close-knit community, shall be a place to read poems, which I see as a good way to get to know people and their stories. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Please briefly elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities or work experiences.

To me, the human world can be as amazing as the music world. ;The store’s boss is a kind person who allows me to stay after work and listen to music alone. Schubert’s Piano Sonata No. 17 in D major, D850 is always my favorite. In music, I enjoy the companion of my solitude.

As a person who tend to learn better by applying knowledge to the real-world contexts, I am particularly interested in the Social Sciences Applied Innovation Lab under the Gateway program, in which I can carry on my passion of researching socioeconomic inequality issues through collaborating with non-profit organizations.

Speaking from my experiences, I interpret it as challenging the status quo in creative ways to benefit one’s community and the society. ;I have been experimenting with unconventional ways to address social issues. Last year, I founded a social service program, the first one of its nature in Shanghai, to bring together volunteers, young kids and the elderly in attempt to solve the seniors’ solitude problem and strengthen the young kids’ social skills. I read on RSVP’s page that Rice students do volunteer work in unconventional ways too, for example, the cooking-for-the-homeless competition. This approach appeals to me because it challenges people’s general perception that volunteering usually means more hard and tedious work than fun. I thus look forward to participating and learning from programs like RSVP.Rice students are more than unconventional; they are happy. In my opinion, their high level of life satisfaction owes a lot to the distinctive residential college system that effectively promotes race/class interaction. Moreover, in such a close-knit community, students from different backgrounds are able to exchange ideas and spark creativity. As an intended Economics major, I would love to imagine I live in a dorm filled with mathematicians, philosopher, artists and sociologist. This novel combination will help me analyze social problems from different angles and a holistic perspective. This is how “unconventional wisdom” is generated.At Rice, I believe, I can receive the education to achieve my personal ambitions and change the society for better. ;"

    "CommonApp": "Superhero fatigue had obviously got the most of the class. Having been bombarded with a dozen gorgeous-looking heroes with shiny hair, bright teeth and great muscles, many of the students started to yawn and look away from the screen. Until the unique superheroes of my creation showed up. Their ugly, twisted but amusing looks soon gathered a roomful of attention, and brought a loud laughter. “You two did a great job!” Someone came to us and said. “Bazinga!” I smiled to my partner.From the minute when we learnt about this psychological project, where we were asked to design three independent superheroes and make a video of them saving the world, we had been going over numerous past images of superheroes in the history. Bored with their highly homogeneous look: charming, neat and muscular, I came up with a bold idea: Why superheroes have to be gorgeous? Ours should be something different, I suggested to my partner, and that led us to make them ugly in a funny way. Then came the story plot part. Having watched a lot of detective movies, I decided to have the superheroes solve a murder. While recalling what I had watched, I easily thought of a number of superpowers it might take to solve a crime. Among all my partner and I finally settled for sharp eyes, sensitive nose and physical fitness. Following the plan, we decided to knead our superheroes out of plasticine. It would be very easy to make, and more importantly, it would make our project an enjoyable one.I began my “improvisation” following whatever popped up in my mind, regardless how ridiculous or inappropriate it may sound. Excited, I put my hands on the plasticine whilst doing impromptu image designs. I first endowed our “sensitive nose” with a specific power to control breaths, with which it was able to blow the murderer to the prison as long as it had its eyes on the criminal; and then I made a small red fan, wrapped it with green plasticine as its headgear, and made the nose three times of the ordinary to exaggeratedly emphasize its power; meanwhile, I twisted the sizes of its eyes and mouth giving our superheroes a distorted sense of charm, which comes from our “weird” design that did not seem to make any sense. In the end, my partner and I agreed to make it more of a character in Sponge Bob. We giggled our way through the making of the “nonsense”, which soon escalated into a sense of great joy and encompassed everyone in the classroom. Together, we made the three amusingly twisted superheroes finally “get into the act”. The enjoyment I had in creating these funny figures knew no bounds. This psychological project turned out to be a success and won us applauds and thumbs-ups. For me, the art of doing things well lies in making things fun. My motivation stems purely from “having fun”, which enables me to fully immerse myself in the process and taste the very enjoyment along the way. Making things fun also allows me to get rid of those “supposed to be” and frees me from “being reasonable”. Built upon the motto of “making things fun”, a superhero is not supposed to be a giant figure in order to “make sense”. Instead, I follow my true feelings towards what I see, hear and perceive and interpret them spontaneously. My genuine sense connects myself with the outer world, serving as the cradle where my instinct rests upon. Why so serious? Why everything has to make sense? Why not have some fun? This is what makes our sense towards our life vivid and count.",

Having actively interacted with people from various backgrounds in Guangzhou, one of the biggest trade centers in China, I learnt to embrace different opinions, and to discover new ways to solve problems. A school of diverse cultures, NYU appeals to me for its inclusive and tolerant environment, where numerous innovative and sparkling ideas have been bred every year. I believe I will significantly benefit from these inspiring thoughts and urther my current psychological research.The great desire to explore my grandmother’s depression also urged me to pursue psychology among the abundant opportunities offered by NYU. Desperate to turn my desire into action, I conducted a research about public attitudes toward depression and its prevention under the guidance of a PhD student. After days of interviews with participants and distribution of questionnaires, I did not only obtain more knowledge about depression, but also familiarized myself with the process and methodology in academic research. Fascinated by the whole scientifically exquisite process, I am greatly attracted to NYU’s wide range of research opportunities, such as laboratory courses including Lab in Psychopathology and Laboratory in Clinical Research, which could equip me with a systematic knowledge in data analysis and experimental design, so that I can further my current independent research.The education of NYU does not just end in the classroom setting. It provides its students with practical opportunities, such as internships and field work, which could significantly improve my ability of practical applications. I am excited to learn about applied psychology offered in NYU Steinhardt, which offers both field work in applied psychology, and internships in Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness, and these invaluable opportunities will help me better apply what I have learnt in a laboratory setting to meet practical needs. Hoping to focus on clinical psychology in the future, I want to develop an innovative and effective way to cure mood disorder, given the lack of systematic organization in the current treatment system for mental illness, especially the one for teenagers. Dedicated to “inventing new ways” to solve problems, NYU could provide me with various kinds of job opportunities through the NYU CareerNet and the Wasserman Center, and the chances to meet talented psychologists can help me to become creative in solving mental health problems and lay a foundation to my future career success."

    "CommonApp": "Last summer while volunteering at a public library, I was surprised to encounter numerous homeless people reading there. Even with no job or home, they still chose to spend their day bettering themselves, reading classic novels, short stories and even literary critique magazines. I used to think homeless people just walked around town all day in rags looking for food, sometimes even resorting to theft. That day, I saw first-hand that many of them were just like us, striving hard for a better life.As I left the library, I felt ashamed. I had always considered myself an open-minded person, but before that day, I’d never even really thought about homeless people. The surprise I felt made me realize how disconnected my understanding was compared with reality, and it really bothered me.The experience was a large reason why I decided to conduct an independent research project on rural healthcare problems in China. Healthcare and homelessness may seem unrelated, but they are in fact closely linked in Chinese society. Both rural residents and homeless people are marginalized populations, socially distant from urban residents. Thus, I wanted to better understand their realities, just as I’d learned about the homeless.While conducting my fieldwork in my parents’ home village, I quickly learned that rural medical services in China are terrible. Villages lack basic medical resources, with many clinics containing a few pieces of poor equipment and a couple of old, barefoot doctors. Accessibility is so bad that some villagers walk 2-hours to a clinic. I sat stunned listening to one old lady tell me that she received only 200RMB medical pension a month. She looked very fragile, with humped back and shaky legs; continuing to work in the fields would surely kill her. I thought of my parents, who live in an urban area. They received far more pension than her, and didn’t have to work into their graves.Many people I encountered were disgruntled and wanted better conditions. Yet, they had no way to change their situation. Most of them knew little about the Internet, politics, or even basic laws. As someone lucky to be born into privilege and resources, I wanted to help provide them a voice, to show them there are city people who care. Thus, following my fieldwork, I returned to my city and wrote a publication on the topic. I then began to give presentations on my work to raise awareness.In my first presentation, I remember many surprised faces amongst the audience. They had never known the challenges farmers faced and were moved by their struggle. This is exactly the knowledge gap – between privilege and non-privileged - that I wanted to fill. My investigation helped them realise what it is like to live in the countryside, to be disconnected and without options. As they left, they walked away with the same sense of responsibility and urgency I had, discussing the content of my presentation with one another passionately. I felt I had achieved something. In fact, after hearing of my research, some classmates followed suit, investigating similar issues. The reception, however, wasn’t all positive. People have told me that such a huge problem is too difficult even for the president, let alone a high school student. Many friends have said I am over-idealistic, and maybe I am. I realize now, though, that I grew up in a bubble, surrounded by many people who simply choose to accept that there is nothing we can do to help. They choose to turn away from problems that don’t directly affect them. I cannot do that anymore. Remembering the struggling old lady and the homeless in pursuit of better, I can no longer remain indifferent. I have to take steps, no matter how small, to fix things that are broken. I have to tell their truths, and use my privilege and resources to conquer ignorance and help those in need.",
    "Supps": "题目：Many human beings throughout history have found inspiration and joy in literature and works of art. Is there a book, play, poem, movie, painting, music selection, or photograph that has been especially meaningful to you?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          In The Castle by Franz Kafka, the main character, K, is requested by a castle to work there as a geographical surveyor. When he arrives, however, the castle refuses to admit him, even though it was the castle that requested K there in the first place; additionally by castle rules, he also cannot return to his previous home. Thus, throughout the book, K is stuck, continuously trying to be admitted to the castle, but constantly failing due to bureaucracy, betrayal, and inhumane treatment by the people of the castle. ;I believe that in this book Kafka’s goal is to depict a postmodern dystopian world where society is ruled by a mindless bureaucratic monster, represented by the castle. The book was unsettling to me because, in many ways, our society treats many individuals in much the same way as the castle treated K. Society can sometimes be cruel, and where there once were ethics and communal bonds, there is now only betrayals and indifference. K thus represents all those who fall outside of the mainstream, making futile efforts to beat alienation from the outside.Probably the most unsettling part of this book was that no one ever helped K. When faced with K’s suffering, most people ignore it, sticking simply to their own bureaucratic processes. They didn’t deliberately try to hurt K, but still acted as “silent accomplices.” As our society becomes more individualistic and materialistic, I see many people following a similar path as the people of the castle, and this path is very dangerous. As is displayed in The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,“First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Socialist. Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Trade Unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.” ;Throughout high school, I’ve participate in many activities aimed at helping those “on the outside”, from working with LGBT groups to raising awareness in healthcare inequality. I do this because I don’t want to be like the people in the castle. I want to always be someone who reaches out to help break the cycle of alienation and prevent anymore K’s in our society."

    "CommonApp": "Last summer while volunteering at a public library, I was surprised to encounter numerous homeless people reading there. Even with no job or home, they still chose to spend their day bettering themselves, reading classic novels, short stories and even literary critique magazines. I used to think homeless people just walked around town all day in rags looking for food, sometimes even resorting to theft. That day, I saw first-hand that many of them were just like us, striving hard for a better life.As I left the library, I felt ashamed. I had always considered myself an open-minded person, but before that day, I’d never even really thought about homeless people. The surprise I felt made me realize how disconnected my understanding was compared with reality, and it really bothered me.The experience was a large reason why I decided to conduct an independent research project on rural healthcare problems in China. Healthcare and homelessness may seem unrelated, but they are in fact closely linked in Chinese society. Both rural residents and homeless people are marginalized populations, socially distant from urban residents.

They are small, sneaky, and always scare people at the most unexpected moment. This seems to match the definition of insects, but of course, as scientists tell us, spiders are not insects. They have eight legs and insects only have six. And most people know this. However, most of us still treat spiders like insects. This shows that to some extent, we perceive the world regardless of objective knowledge. Instead, we prefer to look at things according to our practical experiences, experiences “on the field”.Even when scientists tell us that spiders are very good at capturing mosquitoes with their webs, and seldom harm people, we are still scared half dead when seeing spiders, because we see their creepy, silent movement, but don’t tend to see them eating pest. As a result, our primary experiences with spiders are summed up with “fright, hair standing on ends, and removing spiders as soon as possible” instead of “gratitude, pat them on their backs and a thank you note”.Well actually, we do literally pat them on their backs sometimes, leading to their death.It sounds unfair for spiders, one of the most efficient pest-killer species. We can blame information failure for this. Had all spiders counted the number of mosquitoes they killed and reported back to us humans, we would probably start petting spiders for the same reason farmer’s pet cats. But this is impossible because we cannot communicate with spiders.Spiders are not alone. There are so many similar cases in our society where certain social groups are treated like spiders. They do dirty jobs that seem insignificant. Coincidentally, these people are usually also the ones with the smallest volume—they can’t speak up. Because I grew up in a huge developing country, I have encountered numerous examples. When we think about it, street cleaners are very important to maintain a clean city. Yet in China, the stereotype is “dirty street cleaners with weird accents.” They are invisible to everyone unless they get too close to a passerby at a bus station, and the passerby will notice the cleaner dramatically and move away from her/him. I was not much different from the common passersby before I saw a cleaner near our school asking our English teacher questions about grammar in broken English. His studiousness and industriousness can put many to shame.It is understandable that most of us don’t realize the roles of some social groups in our society, because we are all very busy with our lives and have little time to take notice of this. We can’t blame them. However, I believe there should be advocates for these disadvantaged people, and I am very willing to do just that. There are more and more people realizing the value of spiders, and in China more people are expressing gratitude to street cleaners. Yet this is not enough. There are so many spiders still being neglected; just thinking about it saddens and scares me. ;As such, my goal is to one-day become a human-rights lawyer, who can gives voices to the voiceless. The University of Richmond’s mission statement states the a Richmond education should “prepares students to live lives of purpose, thoughtful inquiry, and responsible leadership in a global and pluralistic society. This statement resonates with me, and as a pre-law Spider, I believe I will be one step closer to helping the spiders of our society. ;"

    "CommonApp": "Since 10th grade, I have spent my weekends transplanting seedlings, planting, watering, and removing non-native weeds at Golden Gate National Park and East Bay Regional Park. The drought has deeply harmed the environment. In summer, weeds crawl on the arid ground like torn spider webs.  Sandy dunes and cracked earth extend miles into the horizon. As I gazed at the cracked landscape, I was reminded of mulch films I have read about in research papers, and felt the seeds of an alternative method to protect plants and vegetation. Aspiring to learn more, I reached out to a senior chemist, Mr. Long at Junyan Technology Development Company in Shenzhen China, and asked to intern as a student researcher in his lab focusing on biodegradable mulching film development.Liquid mulching films are formulations of degradable materials that can be directly sprayed on to the soil to form a thin film. My project involved water saving, weed control by using biomass and chemical polymer. I designed biodegradable liquid mulch formula and prepared samples and tested them through quantitative analysis.As I brought my samples to the local farmers and started explaining the benefits to them, they became eager to learn more about it. I was encouraged when I saw their faces light up. Unfortunately, many became disappointed when they learned how costly they would be. As I walked out of the scorching fields, I was also disappointed and saddened that I could not help the farmers. Then I began to ponder if there could be an economic and sustainable way to produce mulch film.What made the mulch film expensive were the polymers, and polyvinyl alcohol used as a binder in the process. So, what if we could use biomass materials such as wheat and corn stalks, peanut shells, and tree barks to cut the cost in half, but what about the binder? Then, one brisk morning, while jogging, I noticed trash cans containing food scraps to be composted sitting in a line on the street waiting to be picked up. Could recycled food scraps replace PVA and produce liquid mulching films? They were all polymers. Without bothering to change out of my running clothes, I rushed into the lab and tried out my new idea.As I continue to work towards an economically feasible and environmentally safe solution to the problem of water conservation, challenges still arise. For example, how to separate the oil from kitchen waste? After some thought, I contrived a plan. Using high temperature dissolving and then separation by cooling, I can remove oil from the kitchen waste. This removal not only solves kitchen waste pollution but also brings the cost down.These experiences while trying to develop mulching film have shaped my dream to do research in the future and further involve myself in the science community. I came to realize that chemistry is no longer an abstract word in my dictionary. I wish to pursue chemistry to affect a more sustainable and environmentally friendly farming industry.",
    "Supps": "题目：In the spirit of Emory's tradition of courageous inquiry, what question do you want to help answer and why?

This curiosity is what drives me everyday in order to figure out a way that we can travel deep into the universe. However, with our limited life expectancy, yet astronomically vast space to travel, we might never reach the border of the universe if there is one. We cannot give up though, and must think of new ways to reach this goal of traveling the universe. ;I think it is very likely that we can reach far into space if only we can change our point of view: “What if we encode our existence and transform our current life form into a digital form, and transmit the digital form via wave, so that we could decode and restore ourselves on the other end?” I think to myself, “Yes, this could be a possibility. However, what if the destination does not have the matter to build the human body? Where would the matter come from to make the restoration process happen?” My attention was then drawn to modern physics, “In the experiment of special relativity, matter can transform into energy via annihilation or fission, but what about the other way around?” Although the reverse is not confirmed possible, I find it intriguing knowing why it is not possible, or maybe actually possible. I therefore looked into research findings from top researchers in this field including Oliver Pike, Felix Mackenroth, and Edward Hill, and learned about the generation of protons and electrons through high energy photon collision. The protons and electrons would be the ingredients that can be used to synthesize matters. However, as I investigated further, I countered with questions such as “What would initiate the high energy photons?” and “What could be the mechanism to induce the synthesis of matter from protons and electrons?”My train of thought didn’t stop there even though, I never thought that breakthroughs could happen without having the most absurd questions asked or the most unorthodox scenarios considered. Thinking through such different scenarios and seeing the sequence of events provides me with opportunities to piece the puzzle together. Asking questions and engaging in vital dialogue is what will drive us forward into success, even potentially into further deep space exploration. Our universe is expanding and getting larger everyday, and what keeps me awake at night is visualizing what might be out there in the vastness of space. New elements, energies or even life may exist out in space and it is our duty to explore. There was a time when the earth was thought to be flat, just like there was a time when the world thought the sun revolved around the earth. By questioning and exploring our curiosities, we can build new knowledge and therefore a new world."

It was the first day of Chinese New Year, and as the most important and ceremonious festival in China, we never slept late, even after a night of revelry and celebration; instead, we dutifully arrived at a nearby temple to pray to Buddha.At the gate of Temple Mountain before the sunrise, there was already a large crowd of people moving to the temple slowly. Males, females, elderlies, children, disabled, or beggars. For one moment, they were no different, each with the same purpose, to burn joss-sticks and pray for good luck for the new year. I crossed the threshold carefully without touching or stumbling, because every misstep signified the number of difficulties I would encounter the coming year.At the temple, we ignited three joss sticks, kneeled down before every Buddha, and made three wishes for the new year. In front of the largest Buddha, I said, \"Please help my grandmother.\" This year, my grandmother suffered from hypertension, and I usually found her suffering with headaches.However, for the first time in 17 years, I came to a strange realization that I was bartering with Buddha: paying Buddha Joss-sticks and showing deference so Buddha will protect me and provide something in return. So was almost every visitor to the temple, who would not return here again until next year for the next praying for good fortune. While sitting on the stone seats outside the main temple hall, I wondered, \"When did Buddhism become a transaction?\"Many foreigners and even some Chinese criticize ourselves as an ethnicity without a belief, and truthfully, for most Chinese, religion is not a priority. We will not thank Buddha or other gods at an award ceremony, but rather thank parents, teachers, friends. Chinese people may discriminate against different regions and provinces, but never have prejudice against religions. Even a sacred tradition such as visiting a Buddhist temple has become a place for bartering, and where monks sell joss-sticks at expensive prices and convince people they are necessary for good fortune.When I was young, I went to my hometown by train with my grandma. I always remember that night, my grandma put her wallet, cell phone and all her valuables under her pillow and told me to do the same. At that moment, I looked around the train and felt that I was a child in a dark forest, while other people quietly waited like hungry animals, waiting to encroach on me. I became helpless and fearful. In a world where the only belief is that life is a competition where people must do anything to succeed, society becomes a dangerous and fraudulent place.There is a Buddhist scripture I read a year ago. The book was a collection of questions and answers between Buddha and his believers. His answers encouraged students to love the world and help others, and most importantly, Buddha wanted everyone to be responsible for his or her behavior, to restrain from evil for temporary happiness. Those answers were what made Buddhism, or broadly speaking, religions, powerful, because besides laws, spiritual belief can also influence human behavior. They provide principles of morality where there is no governance, so that even as a young child in a wild train alone, I would have no worries.When I left the temple, I made a decision to stop bartering with Buddha, not because of disbelief, but because of respect. Even if I am still atheist today, my experiences have taught me to appreciate true religion for providing moral guidance in society, and that appreciation starts with respecting Buddhism for its intrinsic values such as compassion, and not participating for self-benefit.",
    "Supps": "题目：What question do you want to help answer\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          \"How old are you?\" The recruiter at the firm asked. \"Sixteen,\" I said. \"So you haven't graduated from high school. What can you do then?\" I had been in charge of marketing at my school magazine, and wanted to gain more experiences in marketing through a winter internship. Unfortunately, during the interview, the recruiter hanged up the phone once I told her my age.More than a year ago, in Senior 1, our teacher gathered a group of student leaders and asked us to execute an activity plan she had made. Later, although we found problems with it and proposed our revised plan, she said because we were inexperienced, we should just obey her instructions instead of making changes to the plan.Various experiences like these made me ponder whether qualifications like experience, title, and age truly reflect people's capabilities. Can inexperienced young people like us, if placed in the real-world work environment, do as well as adults? Determined to prove that age is not the only indicator of a person's ability, I started a program in school to try to help talented high school students to find internships that are usually only available to adults.In this one-week research, we assigned students to various firms based on their interest, and throughout the process, we closely monitored how they worked, recorded their work performance from daily interviews with their manager, and tracked how they felt about the work experience. Our results showed 80% students enjoyed the internship experience and felt they had gained various skills and contributed to the firms; from the companies' side, 95% of the managers rated highly of students' performance.In one particular case, a talented programming student was assigned to work in a startup company as a Junior Programmer. After a brief training, he was asked to build a new website for the company, along with full-time programmers and designers. With his passion to coding and quick learning ability, he finished his work with high quality that even impressed those experience programmers.Another student was sent to a marketing department at an education institution, where his main responsibility was to advertise the company to residents of a community. He did thorough research on the community including family income, product preferences, and potential marketing channels. Gathering all information, he presented the marketing plan to the manager, who was surprised that a high school student could consider as comprehensively as professionals.This experience taught me that age has little to do with ability. In this program, young students performed as well as experienced professionals. While I admit that experience only comes with age and needs to be accumulated over time, it doesn't mean that young people should not start accumulating experience sooner. After seeing so many young students doing a good job in the real world, I believe that age should no longer be the reason to preclude young students from gaining valuable social experiences.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Optional Oxford Essay\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I still remember how surprised I felt when I learned Prisoner's Dilemma in economics class. It showed how two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears it is in their best interests. As I learned more about game theory and behavioral economics, I further studied the complex nature of decision making in economics, which has influenced me to consider human behavior and social interactions on a deeper level.Similarly, I am fond of history. To me, learning history not only means reading plenty of primary sources to know what has happened, but developing critical thinking skills that will help me analyze problems in a more comprehensive way. For example, in my studying European history, there are many figures like Cardinal Richelieu, who receives different or even contrasting reviews from his contemporaries and people later. Through the multitude of controversial viewpoints, history has taught me not to simply label \"good\" or \"bad\" to people, but to critically consider various angles.Inspired by these, I hope to fully learn social sciences and humanities in my first two years at Oxford because they constantly stimulate me to gain a deeper perception of people and society, beneficial for my goal to become an insightful, well-rounded individual.In particular, I am attracted by the innovative study approach \"Ways of Inquiry\" at Oxford. In such an environment, I will develop capabilities that transcend beyond simple memorization of knowledge by \"reading critically, communicating effectively, and pursuing knowledge independently.\" With this method, I will not only learn the fundamental concepts in economics and history, but also equip myself with tools to help me better self-study and explore new knowledge.At Oxford, I hope to understand the ways in which people, societies, and cultures interact in the world. Not limited in a certain discipline, I will be able to fully consider the factors that have shaped the past and influenced our current world. For example, I am fascinated to further learn how Nazi came to power in the early 20th century by analyzing the German culture, economics, and politics at that time. Besides, I hope to integrate my knowledge about US history and economics and have intellectual conversations with my Oxford peers to explore ways to further help US prosper.Besides academic pursuits, Oxford is my ideal choice also because of its unique emphasis on encouraging students to hone their leadership skills early on. From my various experiences as a student leader, I learned it is important to have an effective leader to inspire the team to achieve great. Through Leadership Oxford program, I hope to self-assess and discover my own leadership style and to see how leaders can be effective in diverse situations. From ExCEL, I envision myself participating in the challenging outdoor activities, to sharpen my understanding of ethical leadership and innovative problem solving.At Oxford, I know my goals to become a well-rounded scholar and future business leader will come true, and I can't wait to meet with my equally passionate Oxford students."

    "CommonApp": "Not again. It’s three in the morning! The kid on the bed next to me was screaming. It was my special treat for being the only patient on this floor who was taller than four feet and more than ten years old. But that wasn’t all. When sunlight came through the windows, kids started watching cartoons. Mickey was laughing. Donald was quacking. Homer’s “woohoo” kept ringing around me like a mosquito. Will this ever stop? It had been a month since I was hospitalized again. It all started in eighth grade when I was diagnosed with a lung disease called pneumothorax. It was like stunning thunder suddenly comes out in a shiny day. Coming out many whimsical thoughts, I went to search almost anything about this disease to eliminate my horrible guesses.Furthermore, my condition prevented me from doing what I loved, like basketball and tennis . My doctor told me not to exert myself. Lying on the bed, doing nothing, I started wondering what else I could do other than complain and sleep. As part of my recovery plan, I needed to blow up a balloon a few times a day to strengthen my lungs. . One day, while blowing up a balloon, my cheeks turned red. As I finished the  first balloon and gasped for air, I noticed the boy next to me looking at me eagerly, his bright eyes were focused on my balloon. Then, I held out the balloon to him. Clapping his hands, he took it out to play. At least, I could have some quiet time. Hearing their laugher outside, I wondered how these kids could laugh so easily. As I watched them play, I noticed their smiles and laughter as they chased, hit, and tried to catch the floating balloon. The sound was from the same kids who kept me awake at three in the morning, from the same kids that were stuck in this awful hospital with me.I know how it feels to stay in hospital, lying on the bed, tired of TV. The room starts to feel tiny and suffocating. Worse, patients there may not be able to wash their hair for days, and they cannot go to bathroom on their own. It’s hard even for an adult, let alone a kid of five or six years old. Nevertheless, these kids were still laughing with the balloon outside. How could they be having so much fun so easily when they were trapped in this dreadful place? I gradually came to realize that it was these kids teaching me a lesson, the supposedly more mature one.  Unlike me, these kids were creating joy, instead of complaining. I came to understand that complaints only made me feel worse. Why not stop complaining and try to enjoy what I could, despite the awful circumstances. Anyway, this disease, no matter how bad, wasn’t go away. I might as well make the most of things. When my back hurt one night, the boy next to my bed asked me to play with a balloon with him. “Couldn’t you see I was suffering from the pipe inside my body?” I thought. He wouldn’t stop until I agreed. Miraculously, after having begun to play, I didn’t feel that much pain. “I forget about the pain when I play with a balloon, so I thought it would work for you as well”, he said. He was right. I was so engrossed in my pain that I was ignoring the opportunity to feel joy. By me always thinking about my pain, it only become worse. Therefore, this kids taught me to facilitate joy rather than to neglect it. I came to understand the importance of  keeping a  positive mindset in lo places. I then decided to blow balloons for every kid on the floor. I realized that, in a small way, I could make this place a happier community connected by balloons, and I was determined to do it.For now, I am totally over the disease. But the lessons those kids taught me still stay with me. . No matter how bad a  situation  might be, I always approach it from a more optimistic angle. At least, I wouldn’t become gloomy because of breaking a bone. I would consider a chance to enjoy my newly bought New York Times bestseller. Like how those kids that created the joy in an awful place, I too have the ability to find lightheartedness and hope in whatever situation. One night in the hospital, hearing their laughter, mixed with voices from the cartoons, I slowly closed my eyes. While Donald’s quacking is still annoying. I felt more at ease with my place in the world.  “Hey, big bro, you have two options: playing balloons or watching Mickey with us.” The kid yelled by my bed. Well, I guess my plan for a comfortable nap could be put on hold.  “I think I can do both,” I said. ”",

    "CommonApp": "You should behave like a real girl. You shouldn't have to carry our own baggage\", a classmate commented as I dragged a large suitcase down 2 floors by myself.\"Why? I can do it myself.\"Ever since I was a little girl, I have experienced the disparity in gender roles. I still remember my very first roller coaster ride, the ticket checker asked my mother whether she was sure she wants me to try such a dangerous ride, while letting boys flood into the seats freely. While I was in the ride, I overheard some parents chatting with my mother, telling her how amazed they were because I was as courageous as their boys.For much of my childhood, I struggled with the notion of \"how a girl should act\". In China, there is an expectation for girls to be fragile, timid and gentle. It is very common that we are raised to expect protection and assistance from boys because we seemingly lack physical power.Fortunately for me, standards for the \"right way\" as a girl did not exist in my family. My parents had always told me, \"do not view yourself as a weak girl, do whatever you want\".Following their advice I went and did many things that would be considered \"unladylike\". Chasing my male classmates around in their silly game of \"building tag\", I would often be seen running up and down flights of stairs in middle school. When I couldn't find enough girls to play basketball I would convince the boys to let me play with them. By the time I finished middle school, I had more male friends than female friends.Hanging out with my male friends came with its benefits. I started learning more about electronics and computers as we played a lot of video games during our free time. I found myself replacing the boys in various roles, such as the being the person people would go to for computer help when they get the \"blue screen of death\". I was nominated to be the technical supervisor in my MUN club, in charge of all things related to video equipment and software tools, a role traditionally held by boys. I was able to complete creating the closing video for the MUN conference in less than 48 hours. Eventually, the concept that there was a relationship between gender and specific roles began to fade.While it is nice to be treated with extra courtesy, being offered help to carrying things, having the door opened for me, I simply prefer to do things myself. I've grown accustomed to finding solutions and solving difficult problems on my own, because the feeling of being independent and strong is liberating.As I reflected on my development as an \"unconventional\" girl, I had to admit how fortunate I am to have two loving parents that supported my interests. By not living in the frame of a traditional girl, I was able to gain skills and knowledge that I would not gain otherwise. I will continue living unconventionally and exploring all the exciting and interesting things girls are not supposed to do.",

From sketching with color pencils and paintbrushes to drawing with a mouse and keyboard on Photoshop, I don't remember ever taking a break from my most valued creative hobby. This past summer I attended the Carleton Computer Science Institute to learn about image processing and animation. Through this program I learned that the foundations of powerful software like Photoshop and Premiere were built upon numerous lines of codes. In college, I want to combine my interest in computer science and digital arts, so that one day I can work in the digital arts industry, creating software and applications that will inspire the next generation of artists.The Tandon school of engineering is the perfect place for me to do so. Majoring in Computer Science will allow me to build a strong foundation in understanding the theories and mechanisms behind digital arts technology, and investigate how mathematical computations and physics is transformed into the lines of codes that makes up such softwares. Meanwhile, I can take advantage of Tandon's unique resources in digital media education.By minoring in the Integrated Digital Media program, I will have the opportunities to further explore the field of graphics and geometric modeling, and gain practical skills in using a variety of digital media production technology. Courses such as Visual Foundations Studio (DM 1123) will allow me to practice using industry- standard software and the 3D Modeling (DM 2133) course series will allow me to develop my 3D animation skills that I touched upon at Carlton. Furthermore, through the IDM program there will be large amounts of internship opportunities from large media companies such as ABC network to production studios like Marvel Entertainment.In addition, working and researching in MAGNET (Media and Games Network) will accustom me to the real industry setting through working in a studio setting, using industry standard hardware and software, while collaborating in a social hub where I can network with students across disciplines. Courses and projects in the Game Innovation Lab will allow me to apply my programing and animation knowledge to good use.Whether I will become a 3D animator, a programmer working on virtual reality, or the software engineer creating the programs that allows animators and artists to express their creativity, NYU is the best place for me to unravel my future path."

    "CommonApp": "My heart jumped before I could. Hands clenched the protruding rock; feet dug into the cliff’s edge, towering above an abyss—I peeked at it. Oh God. I swallowed my anxiety, and focused on the solid ground two feet across from where I hung. The path behind me was easy to climb up but impossible to get down, so there’s no way back. Were my leap to fail, my life could end. And for the first time, I was seized by feelings of regret. If only I had known I’d be in this situation, I wouldn’t have chosen this route. My friend Anthea and I had walked on the pedestrian route leading to the famed King Arthur’s Throne at the mountain’s top, but I insisted we climb by an unmanned path. Excited, we knew the adventure would be unforgettable…just not this sort of unforgettable. Murphy’s Law, which states that “anything that can possibly go wrong, does”, which I’d often ridiculed, now bit back with a wily smirk. I breathed deeply, and relaxed—feet dug deeper, knees bent, hands released their clutch, and legs sprung my weight across the gap. Blood rushed to my brain as a sense of relief flowed through me and the right hand that managed to reach the ground across. Touchdown. But the soil underneath my feet was too soft. Dirt crumbled through my shoes, and I was almost in the air again. Seconds suspended felt like decades as I imagined my bleak end. I closed my eyes. Why had I always refused to conform to the conventional? Right, always. There I go. Little me, as bold as ever, climbing up the stairs to the top layer of a boat, and trying to capture the beautiful sunset. My mom’s worried eyes spotted me. Though my legs trembled in the sea wind, I couldn’t stifle my curiosity. I wanted to see. There’s another story. “This is not the way,” Mom’s cry echoed in the Lake District in Britain, as I turned left when we reached a crossroad where we were instructed to turn right. I did not want to give up on the opportunity to explore serendipities unfound in our travel guide. The left held the unknown, the unexamined, the curious call towards adventure; the right held its polar opposite. She acquiesced. Although we spent ten times the expected journey to our destination, we enjoyed the picturesque mountain views atop jagged rocks, and listened to the lake’s poetic scenery. Her words seemed more like a joke than a warning. But was I wrong this whole time? This was clearly not a joke. Curse you, Murphy. The moment when I was about to fall off the cliff, I regretted taking the mysterious route. Luckily, Anthea caught me in time, pulled and saved me. Her eyes beamed worry; sweat found my back instantly. Now safe, sound, and in one piece, I felt weighed down by my innate tendency to opt for the unknown. My long-held belief in life, that life is valuable only because I have lived the way I want to live, looked plainly reckless. I held myself responsible for not having thought things through. But if I were to accept life’s paved certainties and conform to the routes trekked by the majority, would I still stay true to my soul and be the girl who’s willing to create things that nobody has created and attempt the unattempted? No. I chose not to regret continuously paving new paths. Making and following my own choices made me know that I’m alive, with a heart accelerated with curiosity, uncertainty, and also life. My soul is free, and my heartbeats real. Next time I will be smarter, taking more into considerations and avoiding to be reckless. But since unexpected sceneries, serendipitous beauty and novel challenges have always been defining my life, I will keep on discovering them, to discover myself.",

I was coding an interactive, projector-powered game for a Youth Hotel in Shanghai, allowing patrons to use full-body motions to mimic projected images on a wall. We hoped it would break the ice among hostel dwellers and facilitate new connections. The error message seemed to make our goal more than just a summer SuperLab project; now, this was personal.  ;I glared back at the screen. Coding had only taken a day, but running and debugging the program had lasted seven—eight hours a day—and counting. My two teammates and I ate, argued, coded, hacked, and slept in a tiny hostel room, battling error after error, until the game's main function ran smoothly. We rejoiced, proud to have fought them all back in time to present it in the Maker Exhibition. The game was well-received, our tutor praising its practicality and creativity. I had tasted a sense of fulfillment from benefiting others beyond the several small projects that had facilitated fellow students’ lives.This Maker Workshop experience, coupled with my year-long project developing my school's homework assignment-collection system “SAM”, the Boxes, and Pragmatist Competition, crystallized my excitement for using technology and teamwork to solve real-world problems. This is why I long for a university that is both entrepreneurial and united—two of Carnage Mellon University’s (CMU) salient facets that drew me towards its College of Engineering.My longing first began with Pittsburgh’s community. Housing the best start-up scene in America's mid-East, this city attracts hundreds of new technological superstars seeking to start their ventures. I love the close connection CMU has built with this vibrant scene, including Game Salad, whose co-founder, Michael Agustin, prides his success to his alma matar, CMU. Possessing the strongest engineering department around Pittsburgh, CMU engineers dominate the start-up arena. There, I would easily gain internship opportunities to further explore ways to connect programming with hardware hacking and thrive as a bold entrepreneur.Teachers. Teammates. Creativity. Efficiency. And Courage. These qualities bloom throughout the College of Engineering at CMU, and they are actualized in independent research programs within Carnegie Mellon CyLab, where I would not only receive professional advice on how to improve my designs, but also integrate into a confident engineering community where talented peers challenge and learn from each other.Such a strong sense of community is most evident in CMU's rich “hacker” atmosphere. I am eager to engage with HackCMU, because I strongly identify with its competitive sports attitude. In CMU, being a hacker means being a creator; being a community member; and perhaps, being a mentor. Even as a prospective student, I feel encouraged to push my boundaries, take risks, and apply my computing skills to activities outside of my comfort zone, while steadily learning along the way. ;Four years—eating, arguing, coding, hacking, and sleeping—at CMU with life-long friends would be an exercise in passion and determination. ;"

    "CommonApp": "Acceptance doesn't come easy. Textbooks on my left, water bottle on my right, I was rushing to the study hall on a regular school day in America. I twisted my elbows and pushed the door with my knees with all the burdens in my hands. As I entered the classroom, suspicious eyes followed my every move. It was a young girl, looking at me, perplexed. She approached me with a question mark written on her face. “Do Chinese people eat frogs?” She asked. I was not sure if her tone was laced with skepticism or mockery. A rising blush on my cheek surfaced on my face.  The truth is; Chinese people eat frogs. Though they are not 'pond fresh', instead they are farm-raised. In fact, I enjoy lightly salted frog meat in a braised soup. I imagine that sounds queasy to non-Chinese ears. I hesitated and vacillated over my response, hoping to shrug off this awkward situation. I knew she was waiting for an answer.  I didn’t want her to see China abnormal, but I muffled an impulse to deny the truth. Why hide the real answer?“Yes, many Chinese people eat bullfrogs. It’s a regional food, though.” I responded in a light-hearted manner, hoping to explain my culture without leaving her feeling repelled. A dismissive smile flickered across her lips: “Don’t they smell gross? Do you eat them?”I knew the conversation was going downhill. Kids are like drunk people. They are brutally honest but lack tact.I responded, “I do. It isn’t nasty. It tastes like chicken.” She declared in a firm tone, “I probably wouldn’t eat that in my life.”I was trying to keep up my playful manner. “Chinese people are brave. If Adam were Chinese, he would have eaten the snake, and not Eve’s fruit. You know people in Florida eat alligators, and some Chinese think that is also different\" I said. Comes with my surprise, she nodded and ran back to her parents: “Interesting! I get it! I get it!”At that moment as the young girl walked away, I saw my family in her. Just like how every immigrating family began when first stepped arrive in a new land, my family was also struck by cultural shock. The first day at the hotel, my dad was at a loss. We always kept a tradition of drinking hot teas, and he realized that the room wasn’t equipped with a kettle.  He questioned me why Americans prefer cold water over hot water, and wonder why such an advanced country doesn't know the health benefits of warm liquids. For me, accepting new ideas and adapting to new culture did not come with the same difficulty as my father. Within a school environment,  I had the opportunities to socialize and adjust to Westerns. For my dad, with my dad's lack of fluency in English, cultural differences were akin to walls that coop him up in that little house. Living in a state of seclusion, my Dad couldn’t go to supermarkets to fulfill daily needs without the driver’s license. At that period, I had an epiphany perhaps I can be the cultural ambassador and help my parents stride over that cultural wall. First my task was to help my dad receive his driver license, passing the test in English. Regardless of grammar tense, but only focusing on the simplest way to extrapolate meanings from keywords, step-to-step explanation was the method I chose to approach my goal. The process was time-consuming, but I felt a sense of fulfillment when my dad drove home alone. I don't mind putting on my part-time cultural ambassador hat. It does not require merely recognizing differences, but I feel it requires understanding, explanation, patience, and time. But doesn’t this worth our effort and eventually turns us to become better individuals?",
    "Supps": "题目：In the spirit of Emory's tradition of courageous inquiry, what question do you want to help answer and why? (500 word limit)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          The mother clasps her child in her arms with tears in her eyes. Her child, with leukemia, lost all his hair due to chemotherapy. The mother is praying that the God would give him a second chance in life, but at the same time feeling helpless toward her affordability of carrying out Bone marrow transplants for the child and the chance of surviving after the treatment. This is the first image that was deeply branded in my mind when I was holding the Careholic Association project in helping children with leukemia. There are, however, millions of people giving up medical treatments because of financial problems. ;Just recently in Atlanta, Trans-Pacific Partnership between twelve countries was officially signed after years of negotiation. While many people focus on the how the elimination of tariff would impact on the domestic economy, I, on the other hand, was startled by the fact that more than 40,000 Vietnamese patients will have to stop taking the antiretroviral medicines used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS as a result of the proposed expanded patent protections. Extending the patent means more profit to the pharmaceutical companies because companies can enjoy the monopoly over its products for a longer period of time, but also means that patients’ choice of taking affordable generic drugs, which the price is 20% of that of original, is bereft. That image of the mother clasping her child in arms re-emerges in my head, and I start to wonder that trade-off between “profit” and “people”, and whether or not, is there a solution to eliminate the problem of “Trading ‘Profit’ over ‘People’”, or is there a way that both encourages the exploration of new frontiers in science and maximizes patients’ benefits?This is the question that I want to answer. I want to find out a way to achieve the social maximization because two goals are indeed conflicted, and the problem is how to find that balance. Learning from my mother who is working as a Vice President in one of the top pharmaceutical companies, I understand how difficult and costly the process of the development of medicine is, as if scientists are searching for paths through a labyrinth. Scientists never know the drug candidate even after millions of experiments. Not only the uncertainty, but also the time and people involved in the whole process make the research and development of medicine a costly task. If the medicine were luckily approved to launch, gaining profit during period of patent would be the only way to leverage the future R&D and encourage innovations. ;The debate over the extended patent protections nowadays seems to focus simply on profit rather than patient. Indeed, profit is the motivation of scientific innovations, but it is time for companies to take on that social responsibility on patients in order to find that balance. Companies can possibly implement suitable patient affordability program to help these patients.

    "CommonApp": "Afternoon that smell like clean linen. Dusk was settling in, and shadows began stretching across the room. It were only Erri, the president of National Honour Society, and I.“Oliver, regardless what others are saying, just chase after honour defined by your heart.” She drew a hand, pointing to my heart.I stiffened slightly. There was another sound saying in my heart.Really?During my elementary school, my honour code was be better than others: I always answered teachers’ questions quicker,which was beyond their expectation ;My homework was always done with good quality,which won me great academic records; at times to donate money for charity,the amount of money I gave in always exceeded two digits. In order to have edges over others, I always forced myself to improve.I simply couldn’t let others stand in front of me after all.However, I ceased to feel content for just being above average briefly. My honour code quickly changed to be the strongest. Instead of finishing some basic homework, I would always ask teachers to give me tough questions. In every group competition, I would like to group myself with people who were unlikely to win. So I could show the weak that my participation could actually reverse their fate. Although competing with the tops and do tough questions actually didn’t help me improve my marks, I didn’t care. My great confidence denied anything impossible. I thought  as long as I had worked out more questions than the tops had, I could pave my way straight into the best class in the best high school and even ranked the first. At that time, I would be immersed with others’ compliments and applauds. The eagerness to prove myself and be the best totally occupied me.In my mind, I stubbornly felt that my honour should be derived from comparing with the tops.Although the dreams had propelled me to devote remitting effort on tough questions, I forgot to review the basics. The Achilles' Heel eventually made me fall 100 feet without anything underneath. I was not even qualified to go to my dream school.  I clearly remembered how I got through that sultry and afflicting summer. The vain brought by the great failure made me feel like being a kite runner who jumped high, in an effort to catch the gold  kite in the sky. I held my breath and open my hands. Suddenly, I stiffened. My arms were not long enough! The realization came too late for me to react. In a split of second, desperately, I hang in the air, watching the beautiful kite drifting away. With a fruitless catch, I fell on the ground hard and ate a mouthful of mud.After my great confidence was shattered into pieces, I was deeply trapped in the marsh of diffidence. At the beginning of my journey in Maple Leaf, rather than be as confident as before ,I chose to be quiet. I forgo the class president election which I was good at. I flinched in the front of group presentation.I used to be fearless, but now I was not only tired of bearing others’ expectations but also afraid of experiencing a great downfall again from the top.The thought that I was not qualified to be the tops daunted me from adhering to my original honour code . Additionally, the new education system prevented me from comparing with the tops by concealing others’ marks. I could only do was shifting my whole attention on my studying. Surprisingly, I felt comfortable without looking around. At the end of the semester, I was ranked 4 in academy at school.With the boom in my academic performances, I started to believe maybe I was not the worst. What if this was a coincidence? What if this was done by pure luck? So I decided to find out more proves. I started to get myself involved into some school activities, such as Basket Boy, English Art Festival and Christmas Party.With my name spreading on the campus, my confidence was gradually mounted up. Somewhere in my heart started to get itchy. I know, the notion of comparing with others and being the best returned. The eagerness to be superior kept scratching my heart.However, instead of chasing after honour blindly like before. I began to question the essence of different honour.There were too many things appealing honourable to me, but which one was the true honour to chase after? Then I met Erri. In that cozy afternoon, she told me her interpretation of honour.Somehow her words point out the direction, but what she told me totally contradicted what I had believed for so long. Was my old honour code really wrong? I didn’t get much time to struggle for the real difference between the two “honour” before I was presented with problems .At the end of the semester, I was offered to be either the leader of the student union or the president of NHS. These two options were wrestling in my head. According to the school policy, I just had one option. I simply could not give up the fame derived from being the leader of the union. However, denying all the values that the club has taught me sounds insane. The former hugged me from the back, tempting: “ Choose me! Then you will get the honour that everyone envies.” The latter touched my cheek, whispering: “The club has inspired you so much about honour.You would not make your own honour disappointed, wouldn’t you?”It was no doubt for the past me to choose the former. But whenever I touched the first option, my heart felt painful, as if it was trying to remind me of the failures caused by pursuing everybody’s honour. You always have time to do it right again, I said to myself. At that moment, I made a bold decision. I chose to say no the past me.I was proud for myself for choosing the latter initially. However,my courageous decision didn’t bring me good luck. I quickly found out that the club which I chose to be the leader of was hardly ever known by the school leaders. My predecessors failed to win principle’s recognition because her projects violated the school polices. I decide to change the principle’s impression towards the club, but hesitation and worries deterred me.What if I became too nervous and forgot what to say? What if the principle simply refused me and kicked me out? I worried a lot indeed, maybe what waited ahead of me was adversity, but how could I scruple if I want to pursue my honour?I remembered clearly how I started my gambit with a slightly trebling voice. What maked the thing worse was that I found out the principle didn’t pay any attention on me. For a moment, I was overwhelmed by defeatism. I wanted to run out of the cold office as soon as possible. However, there was a sound saying: “Oliver, if you give up, you would never know what kind of honour you would get in the end.It is your own honour after all.No! I heard myself denied automatically. For the sake of my own honour, I simply couldn’t lose! Thus, I raised my tone of speaking suddenly. The principle looked up. I caught his sight in the air. Instantaneously, I knew it was my turn to inverse the situation. From the history of the club to its prospect, from the club structure to its members information，I found I gradually got his attention.When I talked about what value could the club bring to school, he took done notes. Especially when I elaborate the central pillar of the club—the definition of honour, he directly fixed his eyes on me.No longer feel pressure, I devoted all myself into the passion for my club. I felt nothing except my blood thrashing through my body.When the time I finished, the wave of passion still hasn’t subside in my heart. Nevertheless, the atmosphere once again dropped into dreaded silence.He stood up. I saw a flashing of smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. He opened his mouth slowly, seemed to gather enough strength to stress every word in the next sentence he was going to say“ Good job, young man. Let’s see what you will get.”An ecstasy hit me. For a moment, I believed I cried.You are right, Sir. let me show you what I will get.I promoted solidarity in the club first, in an effort to unit all the members under my lead. I cut down some unnecessary spending to save some money for the future group project. With abundant budget and a good team, I started to “conquer the campus”. I quickly encountered intense competition. I realised as a leader I should let my members rely on their own discretion instead of being bossy.So I chose to give other members opportunities to run different projects. So our every project would be different that the other The more diverse my club was, the more advantageous it become.  Also, facing complicated restrictions set by the school in terms of running activities, I didn’t resign. I chose to use wits to argue with the school leaders for approval. I wrote petition and affidavit. I used my affliction with teaching department to gain rights to protest and urge changes. In order to tackle the low awareness of my club among students, I got my club participated into all kind of school activities: Sports meeting,  Halloween Party, Christmas show.  After 4 months，no one had still remembered there was once a club, due to a lack of leadership, was suffering from a low attendant rate and zero recognition from the school leader On the contrary, the club now is rising to be the symbol of the school from the sponsor of the school library to the reviver of the English Corner; from the harbinger of the Teacher Professional development to the preacher of the confusion of the both Western and Chinese culture. From the activity enthusiast to the paradigms of academic performances, the club clearly wrote down glories in Maple Leaf History.Moreover, I created a lot of “ the first” on campus. This is the first club which has built a library for a poor village in Chinese rural place; this is the first club which has carried huge amount of money and taken a bus to somewhere 200km far to fond a dog house; this is the first club which  has constructed a platform between teachers and students in which they can further interact by helping each other in the daily life; this is the first club which has  became the business card of the school to attract new members.The impacted brought by my club even exceeded the Student Union at school.Sometimes I wondered what if I was given another chance, would I change my decision of being a unknown-to-everybody club leader again? The answer was yes. As the leader of the club, on the one hand, I have reconstructed and revived the club; on the other hand, the club has built something inspiring in my heart. I have been put in front of many difficulties; I have been presented with countless dilemmas. I couldn’t remember how many times did I fall, nor could I count how many failures did I admit. But, but, there was no time, not single time, did I ever think about giving up. I felt strange for my persistence at first. However, after I ruminated what Erri had told me before, I found the reason. It was something profound instead of ethereal. It was something fundamental instead of temporary. It gave me courage and confidence which enabled me overcome hardship; it provided me with composure when I was crashed by the reality. I couldn’t care less for the extrinsic value since it was so infinitesimal when it was compared with the self-satisfaction brought by my belief. I adhered to my  own honour, that was my credence. That was the reason I chose to be the leader of the club. My honour directed me to a bright future.When I was granted the title of “The Most Influential Maple Leafer”. In that grand ceremony, I stood in the rostrum, wearing a colourful garland, holding a crystal trophy which reflected the purified sunshine. Thousands of students stood below me, silently, waiting to hear my words. They were all eager to hear how could I obtain such honour.I held up the microphone to my mouth, thinking what to say. For a split of seconds, the world in front me went blank. There was only one person in my eyesight. That was me.The “me” who stumbled at the great failure but never succumb; the “me” who sequestered from the crowds and focused on academy; the “me” who reappeared on the stage and be prepared to be the president to chase his own honour.All the events flashed through my eyes. I wanted to grasp some pieces from the stream, but they all fade from my mind.However, there was one thing that didn’t fade. Suddenly, I know what to say next.\"My honour code is to pursue my own honour. That is reason why I stand here.",

Despite my confidence in myself as a fluent English speaker, I could still feel the great cultural difference when situated in foreign land. The same awkwardness also appeared on the face of my Canadian teachers. In order to bridge the gap between local students and foreign teachers, in Grade 11, NHS under my leadership launched the first student-help-teacher activity.  ;From Chinese history to rudimentary pronunciation of mandarin, we “trained” our foreign teachers in various aspects. With no previous experience to draw on, sometimes I was haunted by pressure. I kept thinking about how to be a good representative of the student before lecturing in the Professional Development. Translation of terminology in historical and cultural fields was another obstacle we had to overcome. Nevertheless, as foreign teachers got ever more received in class and their mastery of Chinese vocabulary and culture got even better, I was delighted to see the two hugely different cultures began to integrate under my “match”.Because of my dedication, Teacher Professional Development Program has become the most distinctive interactive platform between teachers and students in the Maple campus. I know in the era of massive cultural exchanges, what I have done is a small step, but I am fully prepared to do more in the future.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Students learn both inside and outside the classroom. What would other members of Carolina community learn from you?

Other teams were celebrating success--riverside marathon held by Student Union gained sponsorship from Coca Cola, and charity performance for autistic children organized by School Voluntary Club received awards from Wuhan Voluntary Association. ;Although I was happy for the success of other groups, I couldn’t help feeling beaten down as I desperately tried to dissuade students from quitting school. “Did we fail?” asked Debbie, whom I appointed as vice president of our NHS club. I had to admit, judging by our current results, we were far from success. With the district’s neglect of education, the attending students had dropped from 30 to 10 within only 15 days, and a water crisis caused by high temperatures made everyone dehydrated. Worse still, my plan of building a library for the school was postponed for lack of support from local government. It seemed failure loomed behind all the ominous signs. But did this also mean that our efforts to create educational opportunities for these disadvantaged students were futile? Was result the only standard of success? I urged myself to search for the answer while hanging on.In an effort to reach the students who were dropping out, I gathered personal information on every child and paid them a visit one by one, crossing muddy roads and deserted fields. Then I redecorated the discarded classroom wherein I built the first library in Jiujiahu district. Every day I blogged about my small daily progress and contributed articles to local news agencies. In this way, I finally drew the attention and donations from the community. In the sleepless and scorching summer nights, my friends and I encouraged each other, telling jokes to temporarily forget the heat.By positively adjusting my expectations and approaches, I eventually made some “small” progress: instead of abandoning the project, my team ended up staying for more than two months. Besides teaching kids how to draw animals and sing songs, we managed to insert real knowledge like biology and physics into our curriculum. Gradually kids returned to our class, and we found ourselves enjoying teaching, enjoying the kids’ smiles, and enjoying hearing them say “Good morning, teacher!” Though what we had achieved in the end was not remarkable by most people’s standards, we never felt so successful. ;At the end of August when our team returned to Wuhan, sunburned, without praise or award, we couldn’t be more satisfied and proud of what we had achieved. Thanks to this experience, I believe I can answer the question: true success comes from self-growth and contribution. While few outside of our small project will notice our efforts, we managed to brighten the summer of a few children. If admitted to Carolina Community, I believe I could share not only my gain in voluntary teaching, but the whole significance of continuous exploration and demonstration of success."

    "CommonApp": "Since my childhood, I was praised because of my genius for mathematics. At school, I was always lucky to be enrolled in “Math Class”, the so-called “intensive training class”. Besides, I achieved good grades in all the quiz and examination. I indulged myself in the pride of being No. 1 and the happiness of being admired.As an elite student, I was endowed with more chances to compete and fight for the honor of the class, even for the school. This year, I was chosen to participate in the training of China Olympic Mathematics National Team for my excellence, which was tailored for teenagers with gift in mathematics and benefited my application for famous universities. Before leaving for there, I made up my mind to make full use of every minute to do exercises in case of falling behind and seize the only six opportunity of participating in the IMO. As expected, the moment I stepped into the classroom, each of them was buried in their test paper attentively with teachers sitting at the back of the room. The depressing atmosphere gripped my heart. I was arranged to sit beside a “legendary” member, who took part in various competitions and won numerous awards. Since we need to take six round of testing to determine the ranking, I spent most of my time on “rote learning”, constantly doing exercise. When the first examination began, I caught a glimpse of my desk mate speeding his pen while I racked my brain. On one hand I was eager to show my capacity, on the other hand I was too nervous to do well. To my disappointment, after the third round of testing, I was at the bottom of the list. Every time, my parents asked me about the results and ranking, I choked with sobs, stumbled over the answer. Perplexed by depression and bitter for two weeks, I was almost beaten by “failure”. I no longer give any thought to ranking and only involve myself in brainstorming when we were faced with a super problem. To my surprise, all the members encouraged me to express my opinions when discussing, which brought me comfort and confidence. Observing besides, I found that they didn’t consider the others as competitors and they were just interchanging their solutions and ideas. Their eyes sparkled every time they were amazed by others’ wonderful thinking. Some of them even dissected their wrong methods, explaining why they were confused without bashfulness. I was influenced by their generosity and integrated into this community, reflecting on my advantages and disadvantages. Immersed in this intense learning atmosphere, I conquered my self-abasement and finished self-positioning. Maybe, some of them were superior to me while the others were inferior to me, but they were all fans of mathematics who devoted themselves to continuous delving. Suddenly it dawned on me that I first came here out of my passion for mathematics instead of defeating myself with “ranking”. Therefore, I decided to get myself adjusted by maximizing my strength and minimizing my shortcomings. In the following weeks, I made my best to communicate with the teachers and solve the problems from a different angle. At the end of the training, I ranked 10th of the 60 members, which was a great success and progress for me. When my parents got the news, they both felt proud of me due to my persistence and counterattack. I finally realized that my obsession with mathematics was not deprived from prizes and accomplishment brought by it, but the pleasure of exploring the unknown. Moreover, my learning attitude was fickle and I should get to the bottom of the principles of mathematics. Although I am preparing for my application for American universities now, I will still strive for the 2016 IMO for my responsibility for my school and my fanaticism for progressing in the world of mathematics.",

    "CommonApp": "The clouds gradually gather, turning the sky a little darker, and the rain begins to fall softly and steadily. I stand in front of the glimmering glass window of the China World Trade Center Tower, holding a file of business news releases for my internship in an Exposition company. Outside the window, I see Beijing's Hutongs, where the houses are hundreds of years old and accessible only by a maze of alleyways. The rain seems to increase the thickening darkness of the alleys, to soften both the city's and my fading history. I recall my childhood in this maze, the ten year old little girl in a silk, frilled skirt bicycling past a pair of stone lions guarding a red, ramshackle door. People around her either amble along the narrow lanes or gather beneath gnarled pine trees, playing card games and complaining about the rising price of vegetables. The walled-in community, composed of old grey brick houses, circumscribes the people's view of the world and prevents them from dreaming big. People living in Hutongs lead tranquil but mundane lives; nearly every adult around me follows the unchanging formula of life, generation by generation. However, as a child, I had always wondered about the world outside the walls formed by the alleyways. I loved my neighbors and the old Beijing community laden with history, but I was more captivated by a world full of challenges and surprises, a world beyond the walls where people were not afraid to pursue their dreams. I asked myself: did I want to repeat this ordinary daily routine again? I heard my inner self saying steadfastly, \"No! I want to see the bigger world, to see what life has to offer\". In an attempt to experience and explore the larger world, I began to travel. I learned about Galileo's tenacious pursuit of truth and bravery in times of persecution when I visited the Leaning Tower of Pisa; I learned about Thomas Jefferson's hardships while drafting the \"Declaration of Independence\" when I was in Virginia; I learned about Napoleon Bonaparte's aspiration to unite the French when I strolled down the hallways of Versailles. An amazing truth gleaned from my travels is that all these heroic figures did not travel the same road to success, but they all lived their lives passionately and never let opportunity pass. As I traveled more, I also met many ordinary people who lived their lives with vigor and appreciation. Every person I met with a meaningful life story encouraged me to bravely find my own path for life and not just to copy the repetitive plot in the hundred years old Hutong alleyways. Such spirit also motivated me to step beyond the familiar and journey to California for high school, where I would not only develop a global perspective but also experience different cultures. So now, I begin to regard my future as my legacy, even before I decide if I should devote myself to protecting the fading traditional Chinese culture or dedicate myself to a career promoting cultural understanding between different countries. I do not know if I will become an accomplished writer who publishes influential cultural analytics books or a successful business entrepreneur who wants to help poor children and tell them that life is worth hard work and expectation. Nevertheless, no matter what path I choose, I will continue to work diligently and always remain impassioned about my life, for I want to embrace all the possibilities of my future. The rain outside the window grows heavier. I glance back to the Hutongs, realizing that no matter how much time goes by, those timeworn alleyways and lifestyles will never change. However, life is beautiful because of its uncertainties and constant challenges. Success is obtained by those who are passionate towards life and willing to take risks. Therefore, I am embarking on my new journey, never to return the same.",

Being able to obtain a solid liberal arts education in NYU with proximity to world-class museums and pubic arts is crucial to me because these experiences broaden my perspective and enrich my mind. ;Walking down Broadway, I join a swarm of lively NYU students switching classes.

Anticipating my appointment about internship opportunities in one of the top institutions in the city with my counselor later in the afternoon, I am aware that NYU brings inspiration to my life and provides me with exposure to real world opportunities. ;As I leave my class, I go straight to the charming Washington Square Park for lunch. Sitting on the benches, I love to appreciate the artistic works of people from all over the world. Enthusiastic about city life, I enjoy the unique ;NYU experience in which I can learn in an environment that transitions between the campus and the city. This enables me to understand more about American culture each and every day. ;After lunch, I go to my \"Social Media and Digital Marketing Analytics\" class, and then hide myself in the maze of Bobst library. While working diligently on my Economics homework and immersing myself in the world of marketing and data, I am grateful that NYU enables me to learn from prestigious economists such as Thomas J. Sargent. ;I am anxiously waiting for the day when I can see the Empire State Building lit in purple during NYU's graduation week and proudly adorn my car with a license plate frame reading \"Alumni / New York University\" in purple letters. NYU, one of the most inspiring, global communities in the world, is truly a place where I will only grow and learn, face challenges and embrace all the possibilities, but live passionately and fully."

    "CommonApp": "My experience with Christianity began when a Korean family next door invited me to their church and introduced me to Sunday School, a place with a friendly atmosphere and tasty Jell-O snacks. Whenever the teachers asked any questions, countless hands shot up, with some kids even shouting out their answers. At age nine, Sunday School became somehow even better, more like a seminar to discuss big themes – life, love, and faith. Unlike in Chinese middle school, our teacher actually encouraged us to give out whatever we were thinking, even contrary opinions. Class went beyond simple religious teaching to provide moral introduction and give us permission of giving out challenging words. It quickly became my dream to be a Sunday School teacher. But when I turned thirteen and began attending Tuesday night discussion groups with adults in church, everyone around the circle was always expressionless. One of my first times, we were discussing the verse \"If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also.\" For me, considering the whole context, it seemed obvious that these words teach us to avoid violence, to love and to forgive. Yet before I was able to speak out, an old man sitting next to me jumped in and interpreted the verse as that Christians should be acquiescent. Though I argued my thoughts, there was a huge silence before a woman countered using another Bible verse, \"Whoever is from God hears the words of God\" – a verse invoked often to defend literal interpretations. These people around the circle, like the Pharisees, stuck to the Bible so literally that they reminded me of the red guards quoting words from Chairman Mao. Yes, they know well the Bible, but what bothered me was they didn't seem interested in alternative interpretations. Entering the discussion group as an \"adult,\" I was disappointed to discover my earlier naiveté: my church, it turned out, was not perfect. While Sunday School provided me with moral education and an introduction to critical thoughts, the church wasn't as open to changes and contrary voices. For a while, I thought of going to a different church. But then, I spent one summer in the US working at a YMCA children's camp. Unfamiliarity to the tasks didn't stop me from getting close to the kids; we could play hide-and- seek together, and I read stories to them. Through these activities, I realized I could pass out my views and values to the kids. It took traveling across the world to realize that I could come back to Sunday School as a teaching assistant, the kind who could advocate critical thinking. Every coin has two sides. Thinking critically about the institutions we participate in is always necessary, as it never works only looking at a good side. This critical approach to my church can also be applied to every ideology—political, philosophical or otherwise. The existence of the flaws in fact brought me closer to my church. It's quite natural that the church is not perfect, so I chose to come back and be the one who is different, promoting what I believe essential. When I teach Sunday School now, during snack time, I suggest that my kids share their food so that they can taste different kinds. I talk to the ones who complain when they don't get food in return. I am an audience to their very valid concerns, but I also encourage them to consider what it might feel like to think about others before themselves. I am careful to strike a balance between encouraging their dissent and guiding them morally. They might not understand or remember precisely what I am getting at. But at least I can offer them the experience I cherished so that when their memories of Sunday School fade, they remember the friendly atmosphere where they challenged and were challenged by a nice girl who kept them company: me.",

This meaningful dialogue has taught me to respect different opinions. ;Outside of school, I taught a workshop on media reporting and journalism to a class of primary school students who aspire to become a journalist someday.

    "CommonApp": "Since I was young, my mother had control of everything in my life. From homework, to friends I hung out with, to what I ate for dinner, everything was planned and organized. To be honest, I secretly enjoyed that, because due to her strictness, I was always the student with the best grades. My father, on the other hand, spent most of his time away from home because of business. Despite not having both parents around all the time, I had a very happy childhood.Maybe I relied on my mother too much, but when she left after a car accident, I felt like the world came to an end. Overnight, the family I was familiar with disappeared, leaving only my father and me to continue; my father, who was born with an adventurous spirit, had to give it all up so he could stay home to raise me.In the beginning, I knew it was difficult for him. He was never known for his tidiness but he had to learn to be organized for both of us. Just cooking rice was a challenging task for someone who had never cooked in his life and sometimes, before I went to bed, I would find him reading some instruction manual, trying to fix the broken refrigerator or other equipment. Many times, he would be multitasking, answering business phone calls while making dinner for us.My father was not the only one who changed. Since entering middle school, thanks to the understanding of school's teachers I have been allowed to attend teacher conferences alone. Knowing that my father would not have time to check my homework, I became best friends with teachers and senior classmates, going to them for all my questions. To keep myself healthy, I even started to workout and swim. Eventually I became a triathlete and even one of the best American football players in the region.However, my father was a quiet man, so we did not have many deep conversations as my mother and I used to do. Both of us were learning about each other and trying our best to be a family, but it just wasn't the same without mother.Last year, I took part of the International Triathlon Tournament in Beijing. Not only was it the first time that I was qualified for such an event, but it was also the first time my father attended one of my events.Despite all the training, it was the most difficult thing I have ever attempted: whether it was the 1.5-kilometer swimming or the 40-kilometer biking, the thought of giving up kept entering my mind. As I started the last part of the 10-kilometer run I saw my father waiting patiently with his camera, hours after the race started, just to capture moments of me. Watching him tolerate the fierce sun to support me gave me new determination to finish the competition and after the race, I hugged him by instinct. That was the first time I hugged him since starting high school.I realized that although my father will never fill my mother's place and love me like she did, it was not because he loves me less. It was only that he had a different way of showing love, which was through quiet support and care. In that way, he has done his best all these years to make up for her absence and I am very thankful. In return, I try to give him my full support. Whether it's cleaning the house together or helping with post-production editing for his business's advertisements, we make a good team. We might not meet the traditional definition of a perfect family, but we have found ways to care for and support each other. I hope my mother, who maybe secretly watching us in heaven, is proud of what we have accomplished.",

With this random video on Youtube, my first time seeing Carleton students really caught my attention.The Silent Dance Party plus some research showed me how students here always do things passionately, whether it's pursuing their academic interests all night or dancing in the library. As someone who always wants to live a fulfilled life through following different interests, I found a reflection of myself in those students. That's when I knew Carleton, with its strong academics and extracurricular atmosphere, was right for me.A film enthusiast who read books like Histoire Du Cinema in his spare time, in the Cinema & Media Studies major I can learn many concepts and theories to better understand works from old classics to contemporary industry leaders. In classes like Advanced Production Workshop, I will keep improving my directing and editing skills. Outside of class, I'm excited to join Carleton League of Independent Filmmakers, where I can gain more hands-on experience as well as discuss filmmaking with other talented classmates.As a sports fan, I will undoubtedly go for the Carleton Knights football team tryouts.

I love this sport not only for the thrill but also because it gave me confidence and determination to take on challenges fearlessly.4 years ago, overweight, nearsighted, I joined school football team out of curiosity. Although scared even of the coming spiral ball, I decided to keep trying my best. I became the first to show up at each practice, training enthusiastically each time. Every small achievement made me want more, from the first time I won a snap to scoring my first touchdown. Seeing myself improve into a strong player empowered me, making me realize that I can achieve great things through hard work and determination. This encouraged me to pick up new interests like triathlon, while putting even more efforts into studying and film editing.Now, with perseverance I've learned from football, I am ready for a challenging but way more interesting future."

    "CommonApp": "As a little girl, I used to travel to the countryside with my grandparents because my parents were often busy. My childhood memories consisted of a few boys and girls squatting on the ground next to me, carefully observing “food” in a “pot”. The pot was actually just a pile of tiles and bricks, and our food was no more impressive – unripe fruit handpicked from trees. We were sometimes scared by the “raging fire” but then laughed at our silliness. Despite the limitation of our entertainment, we were never jaded by the game. That was my first introduction to “cooking”, and the make-believe pastime fostered my interest for the real deal. I decided that I needed a teacher, and there was no one more suitable than Waipo, my grandma. When she went to the supermarket, I followed. When she cooked meals for the family, I watched. When she taught me a delicious new recipe, I memorized it by heart. In many of my summer holidays, she taught me how to cook traditional Chinese dishes step by step, such as the simple but classic tomato and egg soup.“We need to fry the tomatoes first before making the soup dear.”“Why?”“Because it will look more glossy when the juice inside the tomatoes comes out!”“Should we add the salt?” I asked excitedly.“Not yet! When it’s time, I will tell you.”However, the stories between Waipo and I didn’t stay so picture-perfect. As I grew up, I started noticing that I didn’t quite enjoy Waipo’s style of cooking because everything felt messy and complex, with random ingredients thrown in together. For instance, Waipo would add odd vegetables or meats into traditional soups, intrinsically changing the natural flavors that I used to love. Soon after, I founded the cooking club: Culture of Delicacy. We brought in equipment to school and spent countless hours studying different food recipes and perfecting our skills. The process wasn’t easy though: in my high school, academic clubs are seen as more valuable experiences than non-academic ones. In fact, very few non-academic ones even make the cut to be opened. Still, I wanted to venture beyond our usual MUN or debate clubs. While they have their merits, I saw that participating in other extracurricular activities could also be worthwhile outside of academic acknowledgement and awards. I wanted to add my own twist to the recipe of my school's academic life.Sometimes the lack of school support sways me to give up. However, every time I see club members cooperating to complete a Chinese dish, I imagine them carrying forward our recipes in their college lives, cooking together in dormitories. Thinking about the stages we have reached, I am proud of our accomplishments.And just as my Waipo would diverge from the traditional style she was raised with, I began to develop a cooking style different from hers. Each time I chose to venture in a different direction, I had an internal debate, unable to shake off the feeling that perhaps my cooking method was wrong. More and more though, I kept practicing at it, maintaining a light touch in flavors and only adding in extra ingredients after much thought. With time, my dishes took on a life of their own through my new direction. I started realizing that there were no norms or rules in the field of home-cooked meals; it was just a difference in perspective. I took this lesson to heart. Today, I have become more confident in my cooking style. I could spend a whole morning preparing a dish, from buying fresh, raw ingredients to constantly stirring the pot for a perfect broth. For this morning? I made a traditional Chinese dish: a large meatball lying with a head of cabbage. This is my first independent success in the kitchen, ready to be shared with Waipo.My masterpiece — The Head of the Lion.",

I thought it’d be similar to traditional Chinese dance, something I had done in junior high…only, in a swimming pool. I quickly realized my assumptions might have been too simple. Water aerobics require uniformity and synchronization in almost every aspect of our gestures in order to create that artistic design in the water. While for dancing, I viewed the process more as the act of telling a meaningful story, with each dancer as an individual character.Jumping into the swimming pool for nationals last year, I was no longer that curious and nervous girl who first signed up. In that moment, I was in maximum concentration, mind and muscles trained for the demands of our performance.3…2…1…Time for my cue of confidence."

    "CommonApp": "The French musical “Notre Dame de Paris” was confusing for a 6-year-old. Why would a holy priest feel such passion for a Bohemian girl or why did medieval people wear blue jeans and danced in that vivacious way? Yet, I never felt lost when hearing Quasimodo’s hopeless ardor in deep vocal notes or the growing awareness inside Esmeralda in the humming wave of violins. Since that first experience with musicals, I have continued to explore the depth of emotions in other operas including La traviata, the Magic flute, and Der Ring Des Nibelungen. I can still feel confused about the plot, but I know that the arias of Addio, del passato bei sogni ridenti is where I will find the secret pain and sorrow of Violetta.My dedication and passion for music helped me to succeed in entering the Hong Kong Academy for Performing and Arts at 9 and a chance to study with Mr. Gabriel Kwok, the renowned master of keyboard from the British Royal Academy of music. He was the first teacher that teased my clumsy performance mistakes instead of shouting at me and he was the first teacher that insisted we not move on until I met his standards. He was also the first teacher to introduce the concept of sound quality and how music consisted of not only dynamic “forte” and “piano”, but also the colors and contrasts which could be created through differences in the speed and touch of keys. Mr. Kwok’s ideas were amazing to grasp but torturous to master, once forcing me to only play two lines of Mozart Sonata in a whole class. But his wonderful exhibition and patience finally helped me to progress to a new level. He rarely forced me to imagine music in a fixed way, but always gave me space to think and create. For instance, when he made up the story of a hunter inside the forests in Mozart’s Sonatina, he only matched story with three phrases in the piece and asked me to finish it in my music. More importantly, he always emphasized the importance of loving music smartly because finding a balance of passion and rationality when performing on the stage is rare. His ideas about dedication and passion affected my development of piano as much as my top ranked performance in calculus or becoming a top tennis player in my school. Most of all, Mr. Kwok inspired me to give 3 hours every day playing and creating with passion on the piano. After 12 years of piano playing, I can see those black and white keys as part of a cipher box that opens gates to other worlds. Deciphering requires not only correct notes, but also apt feelings. So, I can still struggle to match the variation of Mendelssohn or show the balance between German rhythmic exactitude and Romantic fantasy’s passion, continuing to push on the doors not yet open for me. Yet, once these barriers are opened, I fly back to the Age of Faith through Bach’s Fugues, I am Mozart performing a sonata in an 18th century palace, and I witness the ghosts and gods from legends in Ravel’s haunting notes. There are endless doors in the world waiting for me to discover, with unimagined wonders and secrets behind them. I’ve learned about Beethoven and felt the humanity behind his music, I’ve dedicated 8 years of cello experience to enjoy the group dynamic of an orchestra, and I’ve stayed up all night to feel the natural passion for music during Flamenco parties in Italy. I know I still have many steps to take on my long journey in my exploration of music, and I look forward to each new step and opening each new door.",

It was only natural for me to play “Chopin Rondo”, my favorite piece. As I continued through the piece’s rich mountains and valleys of emotion, people stopped to listen. At the bursting finale, the entire hotel seemed to erupt into applause and the cook went to prepare a special pork knuckle dish for me .This amazing transformation of attitude and emotion through the power of music is why my future goals lie in music and why the dual-degree program at Northwestern university are a perfect fit.I’m already been involved in my own kind of dual degree, going from weekday classes in a top high school in Mainland China to hours of travel for weekend practice and performance in the finest music school in Hong Kong. Going from lectures on19th century Romanticism to derivatives to three hours of daily piano practice is not only a difficult road to travel but even more difficult to excel at. Yet, my journey has been the source of endless joy because I’ve learned to love pushing myself and learning, in the classroom or in Ettlingen’s castle in Germany. This is why I would feel as comfortable among the futuristic buildings on the North campus area of NW as I would in the more artistic South campus area, eating a real hot dog on the North Shore as I would performing and dancing at Dillo Day. I look forward to continuing a challenging and dynamic path in life at the world-class double degree program at Northwestern, which would be the ideal path to becoming a more accomplished musician and educated in a subject I love."

    "CommonApp": "Both of my parents grew up farmers, helping their parents with onerous work and struggling to get away from poverty. In China, if you have a rural household registration,it is much more difficult to do anything in a city: apply for insurance, get a job, or send your kid to school. As a result, young people in the countryside need to be many times more strenuous than peers in cities, where many of the professional opportunities exist, and also have to withstand condescending glimpses from urbanites even as they strive forward. My family is now living a good life in one of the most prosperous cities in China, and despite company and encouragement from family members, they are delighted to have left farming behind. However, when I was eight, they professed that they wanted me to experience that life. I was confused: why did my parents try so hard to escape the old life while still expecting me to sample it?As I beheld the muddy site, I was disappointed and lonely-there were no partners to play with and I did not know much about my grandparents. Nevertheless, crops I had never seen before incited my innocent, curious instinct. I was complacent when I saw what we had accomplished by the end of the day, and all things seemed not as terrible as I originally envisioned. There were, of course, burdensome works that request the strength of my entire body. But when I was working in the fields, part of my blood felt convivial, like a wandering son returning to the arms of his ancestors. What strengthened this unprecedented feeling was the story of my great-grandparents. My grandpa described in a tender voice, “My father was a farmer yet he fortuitously became a resourceful general in World War II. After the war, however, he decided to come back to the pastoral life hoping his family to live in a tranquil condition. Thus the essence of our family still remained.”I began to believe strongly in my blood relationships, seeing myself in the stories of my family’s past. That summer and the summers that followed unwittingly infused me with a sense of labor and unfolded an intriguing history. Recently, although I’ve gone to my grandparents’ less frequently, my skills as an agricultural outsider did not vanish. This past October, my high school offered two options for a service week: studying in schools located in rural provinces or doing agricultural education. I chose the latter, which was regarded as odd because normally, it is students who are not qualified for the first choice that are assigned to the farmland. Moreover, my classmates considered being farmers beneath them. But I could see easily what I would experience if I chose the former, while the latter was full of potential. When I got there, I realized that our work could not be accurately defined as farm work. Commonly, students were murmuring about the hard conditions and expressing their hatred toward the annoying mosquitoes and burning-hot sun, but I felt powerful when I was ditch-digging and turning up the soil, along with other industrious jobs regardless of my occasional asthma. One of my best friends asked, “Why are you so serious about this experience? I mean, it’s not like we have to try.” I hesitated and said, “Well, you know, I want to get the outstanding trainee at the end of the program.”I knew the answer was not strictly true, but I had no better choice. After I spit out the words, I recognized that through my family, I had inherited both the pride and humility from farm work. When I deal with convoluted problems or manual labor, my heritage frames my character to be more self-effacing and tougher. While I have often been reluctant to embrace it,”the relationship between my family’s past and me is always “to be continued.”",

With fewer restrictions and more challenges, people must solely utilize their voices to express ballads, church music, or contemporary melodies. Our school didn’t have a group, so my friend and I decided to establish “Supertonic.”We perform everywhere – school, around the city, and in all sorts of different environments. However, we felt that we needed something more permanent for group members to take with them and contacted a studio to begin our first recording experience.Being in the studio was the first time I felt my significance in the group so clearly. When we performed on stage, I always felt like I sang in obscurity. People usually don’t notice the alto part, since it is often superseded by higher pitches or powerful solos. The audience doesn’t know that, serving as the only alto, I have to be a strong singer, as well as develop other talents, including teaching myself music theory and how to arrange songs in order to keep the group on pitch. ;But, in the studio, I was the first track recorded: only my melody ran through the whole score, and was needed to calibrate others’ intonations, because my part built connections with others’ as a consistent root.I was proud to hold such a role. I am an unnoticed leader who gives other members rhythm and speed, like a solid foundation supporting the whole building.After few seconds, I cleared my throat and sang the first part of my score. Smiles, waves, and raised fists from the rest of the group let my overwhelming nervousness disappear. This magic had occurred before– whether in practices or in performances, our whole group’s determination to be the best singers we can be and the camaraderie we’ve built drive me to reach beyond expectations.A Capella has witnessed my growth as a person. No longer am I the person lost in trying to be a soprano with overwhelming power. Now I am confident about each role I play. Though I may not sing the most dazzling parts, I have at last found the niche for my talents, no matter how much energy it takes. With trustworthy friends giving me encouragement instead of going alone, I’ll continue sticking to all my dreams about music, academics and life."

    "CommonApp": "As a little girl, I was just barely old enough to remember hearing something a woman said. The words melted around the edges of my brain and haunted me. “Yes, girls are inferior to boys intellectually. The only way a woman can succeed is for her to marry well – not study well.”The woman, who later turned out to be my aunt, predicted that as a girl I would be in huge trouble dealing with disciplines related to science, such as Physics, Chemistry or Mathematics. It wouldn't be the last time for me to hear such outrageous comments. She lived next door.Being merely a young girl, I was susceptible to any spoken idea or opinion whether true or false. While her words could have easily taken me down a different path, I was fortunate to take them as a challenge. I secretly imagined a silent battle of “notions”, one that had been put forth by my aunt. Fueled with a strong desire to win, I worked diligently up through junior high earning straight A's and recognition for Most Outstanding Graduate. It seemed I was destined to win the battle.I artfully showed off my success to my mother ensuring that my aunt was present. I waited for triumph silently as my aunt picked up and examined my report card. My fists balled up as she began to murmur to my mom that she should not get comfortable. “She will fall behind the boys in senior high. Boys have an inherent advantage in learning and when they attach importance to schoolwork they will easily surpass girls in science.” Shocked by such pessimistic predictions, I stormed back to my room fighting back my anger, sorrow and indignation.Lying in bed, I realized that the only practical way to change her ideas would be to smash her stereotypical predictions. Mathematical formulae and functions became my most powerful weapons. Economic principles and concepts became my closest allies and brought me much joy. Physics and Chemistry were always on my “favorite disciplines” list, and they helped build up my confidence whenever I easily solved complicated problems using my own skills and knowledge.Gradually, my focus shifted from science to math – the battle I had started as a young girl slowly faded. Algebra, geometry, functions, equations, integrals, derivatives and many more concepts enthralled me and set my mind on majoring in Mathematics in college. My enthusiasm for science, especially the mathematical aspects allowed me to compete against my male peers and ultimately shatter “traditional” stereotypes regarding girl's education.Immersing myself in math and enjoying school life, I had no time to pay attention to what my aunt had said. However, to my surprise, she surrendered and demonstrated great respect for my accomplishments in senior high. She said to a neighbor, “My niece is smarter than any boy I know!” Victory was mine!As in most stories, a satisfying ending contains a protagonist overcoming obstacles through hard work and determination. I merely won a battle with a typical stereotype that had been embedded in my aunt's mind. China, regrettably, has numerous stereotypes just as my aunt had. In class meetings, parties, and even family reunions, little seemingly harmless comments infect others with the presupposition that girls are inferior to boys. To me, this situation seems desperate and even heart-breaking. I realize that no matter how hard I work to eliminate bias and discrimination, most of the time I will fail. But I realize the interconnectedness of the world in which we live, and I firmly believe if every girl put efforts into proving those notions false and fighting against discrimination, the world could be greatly influenced and eventually changed. While it seems unlikely that such a utopian idea could ever come to pass, we all must start somewhere. I am drawing a line in the sand and I will help others do the same.",
    "Supps": "题目：Johns Hopkins School Essay\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I have derived my interests in applied math and statistics from playing bridge. Playing against professional bridge players is not merely a test of your familiarity with bridge rules, but also a competition where participants show mastery of logic, statistics and mathematics. They are magicians, turning conceptual knowledge into useful weapons against the opponents.Focusing on a combination of abstract theories and practical use, I attach great value to Hopkins’ spirit of research and exploration. Hopkins is my magician! In an age of knowledge, information, and technology explosion, it is not enough to be merely a dull receiver of formulae and principles – actually, it is essential to employ what you have learned and create your own knowledge. “At Hopkins, we don’t just disseminate knowledge. We create it.” Most Hopkins students, enjoying the abundant research resources at Hopkins both inside and outside the classroom, take advantage of the theories and skills they learn in class to solve realistic problems. Yearning to be a superb researcher, I expect to enrich my experience, transcend myself and make original contributions actively to my area at Hopkins.Hopkins’s motto, “the truth shall make you free”, inspires me by revealing that the only way to rid ourselves of ignorance is to approach the truth faithfully and persistently. Seeking truth incessantly and learning voraciously are essential to success! Thus, I regard Johns Hopkins University as a perfect match and the best place for me to thrive. The well-planned courses provided by Hopkins covering multifarious areas such as linear algebra, differential equations, discrete mathematics and statistics will help me construct a complete system of knowledge. Other courses taken in my area of focus may enhance my understanding of a particular field and lead me to approach the core of it. While self-studying AP statistics and calculus, I relished the experience of exploring a new area by myself but would also highly appreciate a mentor who could guide me from confusion when needed. Renowned for its outstanding teaching quality and unparalleled professors, Hopkins is a wonderful place for me to achieve academic excellence.Moreover, Hopkins attracts students all over the world because of the precious opportunities to broaden their horizons. For example, the Hopkins Engineering Exchange Programs in multiple countries will offer me new insights into international engineering study and countless advantages in global competition with independent life skills and resourceful knowledge. Having developed an extraordinary enthusiasm for cultural exchange and fresh academic experience during Crimson Summer Exchange Program, I would like to explore social science and natural science and learn local culture in Hopkins University College London. I would also like to walk in the campus of National University of Singapore and discuss with the exceptional professors there.Overall, the profound research resources, the world-class course design and professors and endless opportunities for students to achieve all-around development at Hopkins will guarantee a promising college life for me. I sincerely hope to embark on a refreshing journey at Hopkins and become a part of its proud heritage."

    "CommonApp": "“Hey, Ivy! Let’s skip P.E. class together, it’s so boring.”“Well, all right,” I responded.Though I actually wanted to attend class instead of gossiping meaninglessly with my friends, my feeble intensions were quickly conquered by the fear of being left alone. Yes, I was afraid of loneliness. A good follower as I was, I tended to ignore my true desires and end up following the mainstream.The turning point appeared when I encountered the terrifying P.E. Test, an indispensable part of the senior high school entrance exam. I was really anxious as I did extremely poor on running. So when my friend Helen suggested practicing running after school, I immediately agreed.On the first day after evening self-study, I failed to find Helen. For a moment, I felt isolated and helpless. The sky was black, the birds were silent, and the runway was endless. Overwhelmed by the silence, I got frightened. I wanted desperately to go home. But then I imagined what might happen if I failed in my P.E. test. Almost instantly, the sorrow devoured my whole mind. I lingered for a while, and then I took a deep breath and began running. Soon after, I started panting. My body became fatigued and my heart was beating fast. Paying no attention to my body’s complaints, I kept running, albeit at a slow pace. Gradually, things started to change. I felt like everything inside me was vibrating with energy. All the components of my body, after sitting at desk for days on end, were enjoying the relaxing rush of movement. Without noticing, I reached the finish line. I was so surprised. When practiced running with my friends, I always struggled to keep up with them. Unsurprisingly, my energy was used up quickly and every step seemed a form of physical and psychological torture. Ever since that day, I began to enjoy practicing running alone. I felt unrestrained and free, as I could master my own pace and set my own goals. I practiced every evening in the moonlight’s shimmer, and worked consistently to break my own records. After almost every practice, my body was sore and my breathing was heavy, but I still felt cheerful about any improvements in my running time, no matter how slight. Days of practice brought me a strong and unprecedented feeling of self-achievement. And when someone did run with me, I was able to keep my own pace.After one month of training, I got a full mark on the physical education exam. I really appreciated that experience and all of the nights leading up to it. Also, I discovered that my fear towards loneliness had disappeared.  I learned to enjoy being alone, when I could have more time to enrich my inner world. From then on, I no longer wavered among different people’s viewpoints, but insisted on my own perspectives. I started enjoying what I truly wanted to do, like reading books about modern science and cooking, instead of accepting every party invitation. I was fascinated by the wonders of the World and I am determined to explain them scientifically. One day, I will figure out “theory of everything” and step into every inches of the Earth. Whenever I feel confused, I still run alone on the track. Running in the wind, I decided to continue my education in the US while most other peers chose UK; listening to my heart beats, I confirmed my future plan and determine to embrace infinite possibilities. No longer a follower anymore, I am now an optimistic, confident and strong-minded girl. I am able to take responsibility for every decision I make. Moreover, my confidence helps me stand out and contributes to my success of being a leader in our Student Union. To me, it is not only a change from a follower to a leader, but more importantly, from a child to an adult.",
    "Supps": "题目：Last August, Susan Grant, chief nurse executive for Emory Healthcare, said this of Emory’s choice to treat patients with Ebola: \"We can either let our actions be guided by misunderstandings, fear and self-interest, or we can lead by knowledge, science and compassion. We can fear, or we can care.\" Consider her idea of doing what is in the public interest despite potential cost. Please discuss an example in your life or the life of another that's come to your attention. (500 word limit)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I used to believe I was living in a peaceful era. I could not even imagine the cruel wars, where blood and bones were scattered everywhere, had actually occurred in the reality. In my world, life is filled with opportunities and hopes, and all the people are making effort to strive for their own well-being, wealth and social status. As soon as I grasp the opportunities and realize my goals, I can gain rewards and lead a life I dreamed for. However, my attitude was profoundly challenged when I encountered a special person, and an inspirational organization. ;Recently, I read an article saying that a Hong Kong lady, Jiexin Huang, quitted her rewarding job at Ming Pao Weekly, and joined in a non-profit organization called Doctors without borders. To be honest, I was confused. Why did she give up such a decent job and choose to work in places of danger and poverty? Astounded by her example, I was exposed to new land which I had never paid close attention to before. I had no idea that there is a corner on earth called Republic of Liberia, which is crammed with wars, diseases, and poverty. It is a region where infant death rate is as high as 15% and people have to dig over forty meters to get “drinkable” water.In such severe conditions, medical volunteers, like Jiexin, still persist in their responsibilities. They do not just provide basic medical treatment to that chaotic place but more importantly, they bring love and hope to those desperate and abandoned. “You cannot see Needs if you close your eyes.”  ;Jiexin said. Although those volunteers lost their time to enjoy family’s company and material satisfaction, they still love their jobs for the enrichment which can never be substituted by material possessions. We frequently hear the news that some regions are under a threat of torturous diseases and in urgent need of medical assistance, but we seldom take action. However, under huge pressure people like Jiexin give up their prestigious social status and devote to humanitarian assistance despite potential costs. ;Thanks to Doctors Without Borders, I realized the infinite possibilities of life. Not everyone’s dreams are the same as what I pictured before. What I believe commonsense is built upon the fact that I live in a safe environment with medication, education and family.  ;We live our lives only once, we have different pursuits and dreams, and we will gain mental happiness for realizing our own values. From then on, I no longer isolated myself in my own world, but began to help those unfortunate with my little savings. I want to develop a mature medical system and a complete education environment for them and let everyone live with dignity. Even though I am not capable of accomplishing my dreams now, I expect to be a part of this organization when I accumulate enough professional knowledge. Just like Jiexin, I will stay truthful to myself bringing joy and hope to people in need."

    "CommonApp": "I don’t remember much about her appearance. Maybe the only distinctive feature was her darker skin, indicating she was from remote southwestern China, where the sun is stronger. I thought our paths were just separate trajectories, randomly intersecting at one point for the five days when she attended my high school as an exchange student. However, she had an incredible impact, teaching me that being strong means facing yourself, your past and being open to others.For the whole week, we barely talked. She sat next to me in class, but the only words we exchanged were something about the class schedule and school cafeteria, and even these conversations ended quickly. In the dorm, she remained quiet and read a novel, without looking up. I barely noticed as she wrapped herself up in a small corner of her world. The final exam was coming, and I busied myself with homework.The truth is, I had my own small corner of the world where I was also hiding. As I threw myself into finals, I knew, deep in the dark attic of my mind, I was trying to forget that the anniversary of my father’s death was approaching. My father passed away when I was young. Growing up, I never told anyone about my family; in daily conversation, I even changed “my mom” into “my parents” to avoid suspicion. I felt that burying this secret was the best way to avoid being seen as too vulnerable and appearing inferior in some way.I had never considered opening up about my past, but this quiet stranger changed that. Upon returning to my room the day she left, I saw a letter on my table and read it. Dali (I had even forgotten her name) apologized, saying she was once much more outgoing, but her parents recently divorced, which is still somewhat taboo in China. “I grew more and more reticent and reserved, unconsciously, maybe partly as the way to protect myself from getting hurt again.” I trembled as I read. I could understand every word describing how she was affected because I too felt weakened by the tragedy in my life. But her next words struck me even more. “I signed up for this exchange program in hopes of making new friends in a different city to start afresh, but I didn’t know how to open up. I am so sorry.” She also thanked my roommate and me for our warmth and kindness.After I finished the letter, a mixture of guilt and regret swelled within me. Nothing I did could be construed as warmth! However, what shocked me most was her bravery to expose herself so honestly in this letter. And while Dali felt she had failed in her goal, I recognized the courage it took for her to try and move forward, to open up and make changes in her life. I avoided, I hid, I even lied about my past. I envied her strength.Dali taught me that facing pain and sorrow is not equivalent to surrendering to it, which helped me accept my past to heal and move forward. In time, I realized that I have the strength to be vulnerable, and that living openly and honestly leads to stronger relationships and a more fulfilling life. I still regret, so deeply, that I did not reach out to Dali. In being consumed in my own world, I lost the opportunity to learn more from hers. Being distant or detached means lost chances to partake in a splendid life; we could have supported each other through our journeys, and learned from one another. But thanks to Dali, I will now never forget that each passerby has a life as vivid and complex as my own.She will never know the effect she had on me, but because of Dali, today I am stronger and more open, to everything and everyone.",

We know nobody fits neatly into 500 words or less, but you can provide us with some suggestion of the type of person you are. Anything goes! Inspire us, impress us, or just make us laugh. Think of this optional opportunity as show and tell by proxy and with an attitude.

Just like the heated beverage with floating marshmallow that can save a bad day, I can always cheer myself up with optimism. I remember on my first day to attend Plato’s Symposium Seminar, a typhoon struck Shanghai with pouring rain. “You will get completely soaked if you insist traveling across the city just for a two-hour discussion session! Give up the crazy idea.” I thought to myself. However, I then recalled the previous night I spent diving in the obscure text of Greek philosophy. The annoyance of terrible weather only compared to be trivial when I looked on the bright side---the excitement to share my understanding in the notion of love presented in Symposium as well as discuss with college advisors majoring in Classics and Philosophy. At the bookstore where the seminar was held, I showed up with hair dripping with water, but also with a smile.I am cinnamon black tea with a pungent flavor. While black tea is universally popular, not everyone finds the taste of cinnamon enticing. It’s exactly the same case with the hobby of solving puzzles; not every jigsaw lover understands why I don’t mount my finished work to a board and treasure it forever. When a fellow jigsaw lover saw me taking apart a massive puzzle that took me months to complete, she nearly screamed. But I can’t help it; once I’ve completed a puzzle, I immediately take it apart, piece by piece. The reason is simple: when I stare at the completed picture, I only see the result of my efforts, an end-product; instead, if the puzzle pieces are back in a state of chaos, what comes to my mind is the fulfilling joy of molding the seemingly unrelated mass into a finite object. For me, the process is always more vital than the final accomplishment.I am peppermint herbal tea with refreshing aroma. While peppermint stimulates the nerve, thinking from another angle stimulates my creativity. “Fewer readers are coming to my blog where I posted all my recent reviews on contemporary Chinese poems. Maybe I simply can’t write anything good.” Staring at the message from my friend, the founder of the poetry club at my high school, I stopped to search for other possibilities that caused the problem other than putting blame on the quality of his writing. Maybe he didn’t target at the right readers? Soon I came up with this idea of extending the readership by helping post his reviews as an online magazine series so that they can be shared on a larger scale. My friend not only found more readers than ever who like and support his works, but also was motivated to continue analyzing the symbolism and context of selected poems to introduce his passion for poetry to more people. Whimsical ideas come up to me when I manage to change the perspective and think differently.3 teaspoons of optimism, quirkiness and ingenuity plus one crucial drop of William & Mary undergraduate education. Time to enjoy!"

    "CommonApp": "The last dish of the Chinese New Year meal was being served – a traditional fish dish that immediately filled the room with a sweet-and-sour odor and white steam. Not long after it lands on the table, chopsticks were clipping together and spoons were diving down into the fish, almost finishing the delicacy in minutes. Before the last bites were taken my grandpa interrupted, “It’s time to stop eating! We must leave some leftover!” My cousin who moved to America at the age of seven asked in an astonished voice: “Why shouldn’t we finish the fish? It’s so delicious!” Hearing his question my family all laughed – we realized that he had been living abroad for too long. Smiling, I explained to him, “Don’t you remember that the pronunciation for “fish” and “surplus” is the same in Chinese? We leave the fish unfinished because we want a surplus of precious things in life too!”My family always united in Nanjing for Chinese New Year, but that year was especially important since it was my grandma’s 90th birthday. Thus, three of my cousins who were living overseas came back to Nanjing, but understandably they appeared to be somewhat removed from Chinese culture.My cousin’s question about the dish prompted me to think about all the important traditions my family still holds on to. During the Lantern Festival, when many people just go to the supermarket to buy some frozen dumplings, our family would always watch dragon dancing in Lian-Hua Mountain. While many people have forgotten the real meaning and family connotations connected to the Double Ninth Festival, our family would always climb a nearby mountain and pay respect to our older relatives. Sadly, nowadays many Chinese people seem to have forgotten important traditions while money is now coveted over anything else. Indeed, China has changed enormously after it “opened up” to the world, and this great transition raises many questions in my mind. “Have Chinese people gradually overlooked many traditions because of western influences? Is the West responsible for bringing a bourgeois and materialistic culture? Should we blame the West for the changes taking place in China?” Harboring these questions, I asked my cousins their opinions on the West and also why China appears to be forgetting traditions. Contrary to my preconceived idea that the West had somehow “ruined” China, they commented that from their observations Western society still values traditions in many ways. Families always unite on Thanksgiving and Christmas, parents often serve as “soccer moms” or “baseball dads”, and people often value family over money.Hearing their thoughts, my worldview suddenly appeared much too narrow. Sadly, in sharp contrast to what my cousin described, many Chinese sent their children to be raised by the Grandparents and many couples seldom live together, all because of the excessive desire to pursue money, power, and fame. I once read an Australian’s article on Chinese: You guys are very hard-working and make a lot of money, but I think you don’t know how to enjoy life and care for the family. After that union in Nanjing, I had deeper understanding of responsibility and traditions, and I realized the importance of pursuing the real treasures in life rather than the superficial ones. In the future, no matter what part of the world I am, opening to new experiences will be part of my life, but I would never forget that my roots are planted in China, that old, timeworn house in Nanjing. Sitting around that dining table where we spend our spring festival every year, leaving that little bit of leftover fish and embracing the traditions that I grew up knowing and loving – ones that I will continue for generations to come.",

This torch not only serves as a symbolic beacon calling me to New York, but also as a source of inspiration to further ignite my passion for dynamic experiences both in and out of the classroom. The ‘light’ that NYU offers will serve to illuminate my life, career and future.Illuminating a path for a brighter future. While pursuing a major in environmental science at NYU, I dream someday of bringing China out of the ‘darkness’ that it currently faces with its detrimental smog problem. Remarkably, NYU offers courses that will give me the knowledge to take on such real-world problems. Within the Environmental Studies Capstone Seminar, students excitingly use all the theoretical knowledge learned in class to tackle practical problems. Previous topics included solar power projects, green roof design and green household development. These current, practical projects will serve to inspire and allow me to create new projects for a brighter future in my homeland.Igniting passion for taking action. As an international student, NYU’s International Environmental Law Clinic is something that truly excites me. Within these clinics students have been able to draft laws and regulations as well as undertake research for organizations like the UN, international NGOs and governments of developing countries. Real-world opportunities like this not only serve as vital examples to learn from, but also as forms of action that will directly tackle current issues that I am passionate about. ;Enlightening me in ways that only New York City can. Relaxing in Washington Square Park, catching the latest opening at the MoMA, trying the variety of delicacies hailing from around the world or joining NYU’s tennis club – my daily life will be filled with a myriad of experiences. The sights, flavors and people of NYC will allow me to become more than just a citizen of China. Within this international setting that fosters dynamic students, I will train to be a glowing citizen of the world.  ; While the NYU logo simply consists of a torch and three letters, the simplistic design carries connotations that create feelings of passion and burning inside. This fall 2016, I am ready to let this passion fully ignite and start on a path of enlightenment that only NYU can offer, and I will learn to light and carry my own torch into the future."

    "CommonApp": "‘My boyfriend quarreled with me yesterday, but I don’t think he wants to apologize for his rudeness.’‘Physics is too difficult. I don’t want to learn it any longer!’‘I studied till midnight yesterday, but my mother still said I’m not hard-working enough.’……    As a mediator, I get a variety of such information every day, and what I do is to give them suggestions, rekindle their hopes, and let them continue to do what they should do. Though giving different ideas every day, I have already been familiar with this situation. The reason why I insist is that I not only feel proud when I manage to help others, but also gain progress for myself. From the story of Jasper and his girlfriend, I learnt that explanation is much better than a fight. Dealing the problem of Ashley’s relationship with his mum, I got alone with my parents much more harmonious….. As the old saying goes, Lookers-on see more than the players. I’m very grateful for the special position of mediator, which enables me to consider the complete matter as a whole and improve my life without meeting the setbacks my friends have gone through.However, there are many people who cannot understand my deed. Jim once considered my behaviors as ‘a waste of time’, which made me wonder for quite a long time. ‘Except getting pride and avoiding the same problems, what else can l benefit from the ability of communication?’ I asked myself. ‘I don’t know.’ A voice rose from my heart.A year passed, and I became a high school student. I joined 3H club (two hands together with one heart), which held an activity with students from a primary school in Kenya. We took lectures about their lives and made Skype with them, from which I learnt that their education is incomplete and living condition is poor. Later on, from the letters I wrote to my Kenya friend, Hank, I realized more about their lives, so I helped him as much as I could in academic tasks, told him the interesting life in China, and encouraged him to develop his potential and be optimistic about everything around. This January, Hank said he felt very energetic and full of hope no matter what he did and thanked me for my inspiration, and I suddenly realized that it was my communication with him that helped him so much and even changed his attitude towards his life. To my great surprise, when I meet some challenges, Hank’s words and the scene of his life always appear in my mind and tell me to persist instead of losing hope. ‘Is this the benefit of communication?’ ‘Perhaps.’ The voice said, indecisively.Based on this experience, I was more interested in developing my communication ability. As the commissary in charge of sports in class, I arranged the enrollment and practice of the sports meeting. Although there were many contradictions during the process, I communicated with every member that participated in the match and told them to cooperate, and I settled the conflict successfully and our class got many awards in the sports meeting; Learning that Chinese’s environmental pollution is quite severe, I joined a project about perfluorinated compounds at college this semester. I carried out research about the best extractant, and based on our communication, we managed to discover the basic characteristic of the compounds and the harm they did to people. ‘Is this the benefit of communication?’ ‘Exactly.’ This time the voice no longer hesitated.Now I realize that my ability of communication may not be limited to mediate life trifles but may bring me optimistic and the spirit of cooperation as well. But to the most part, my passion for communication may even contribute to the team and the social life, and I will certainly spare no effort for it in the future.",

I believe the Major of Chemistry in USC will enable me to better connect chemistry, the environment and humans together.Independent research has been among my most valuable experiences. Last year, I experimented to find the most effective flocculants water-cleaning agents by comparing important factors such as particle size and temperature. This year, I did another project about perfluorinated compounds in indoor areas and constructed models to understand the harm they cause to people of different ages. These two projects let me realize the seriousness of the crisis around us at present, but more importantly, I come to know that my dream to improve the world is not untouchable. Thus, I attach great importance to research, and am excited about the cutting-edge research opportunities in USC, specifically, the Center for Advanced Sustainable Energy(CASE). Aiming to develop new technologies to collect and store energy sustainably, I am enthusiastic to help with such innovate work, and all the while, develop my own skills in research as well.Undoubtedly, knowing more about the damaging pollutants that are affecting our health, I won’t be satisfied until I make a meaningful contribution. With my perseverance and diligence, I am confident that I can reach my dream."

    "CommonApp": "My grandma once performed an exorcism on me. She caught me weeping while reading Uncle Tom's Cabin, so torn over Eva's death that I lost my appetite to eat. In her eyes, it is ominous for a child to weep before a meal, so she thought that I must have been possessed by some evil spirit needing to be removed. Of course, I stopped weeping soon after she rubbed her warm hands over my forehead, amusing me tremendously, but which did not dull my love for reading.Another time, I was reading a biography of Nalanxingde, a Qing Dynasty poet from a declined noble family. Fate assigned him a tragic life, instilling his poetry with heavy sentiment. I became so fascinated by his story that I was still reading at 1 a.m. When my mom discovered the light in my bedroom, she was so vexed that she grabbed my book and chucked it in the corner without a word. Despite my chagrin, I yielded to her totalitarian authority, and spent the rest of the night worried for the poet's uncertain fate.My mom and grandma eventually concluded that my excessive obsession with reading is genetic, a fact not entirely baseless. I was raised by my grandpa, who taught me the beauty of language. During the Cultural Revolution, the school he taught became a \"cattle shed\" to \"convert\" him and his fellow intellectuals. His books were burned, property confiscated, and he did the most laborious work for pursuit of learning. However, decades later, he is still a voracious reader of everything from news articles to research papers, from ancient volumes to newly published novels. For my third birthday, this same man bought me albums of Chinese characters, and gave me fairytale books as soon as I could read. Because of his open-mindedness, I was able to appreciate the deep ocean arena with Captain Nemo in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and experience the compunction of Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment. I will always remember the amazement in his eyes when I read Unsolved Mysteries of the World, inverted.Unbeknownst to my classmates at school, the small town seemed to shrink with each new book I encountered. Colors seemed to fade when the only channel available played the same show over and over again, before the benefits of modern access to information extended to this rural town. The flowing river, our bungalow not far from it, and the dogs and chicken reared in front of our bungalow, they accompanied me and nurtured me, but they no longer satiate my desire for knowledge.I remember when Charles Strickland (from The Moon and Sixpence) finally abandoned everything to move to Paris for the sake of painting. There was something about him that I admired, that I wanted to learn from, as if my pursuit of knowledge can transcend anything, much like his burning love for art.When my grandma attempted to remove the ominous spirit in me, my grandpa looked up from the book he was reading, and smiled. It was a warm smile, with a glimmer of compassion in his eyes, as if he just came back from paradise and found me in this shabby reality. He understood. In some ways, I think it was a part of his plan from the beginning, to show me the world through novels so that I'd be emboldened to someday see the world for myself, accomplishing what he failed to do in his lifetime.Over the years, I have lived vicariously as the adventurous Passepartout on his serendipitous journey, the resourceful Huckleberry Finn in brave pursuit of freedom and justice, and, at times, as Sabina who has tasted the delicious lightness of life. Then, I am reminded that I'm the writer and protagonist of my own novel, and that there is a brand-new chapter in front of me, waiting to be composed.",

I wake up to jog with several friends on campus. Our morning talk fills the air with a mix of distinct accents, filling me with energy to make today a great day. It gives me the feeling that I don’t have to travel the world to see it; I can simply knock on the door of my neighbors to glimpse into their lives and culture. Yet most importantly, despite our differences, we share a deep sense of belonging; we treat each other like family. ;Following a quick breakfast, I rush to my favorite class by Professor Rajeev Patke, a renowned scholar. After class, as my classmates and I walk to the dining hall heatedly debating Professor Patke’s lecture, we encounter him again and he gives us an improvised speech right there, leaving us in awe once more. Drifting back to the question, I think I have an answer. Beyond just the degree, I believe a strong college community is what will shape me into a greater person. College is where I will meet supportive lifelong friends, create memorable experiences, and refine my work ethics and values. For that, I want to join the YaleINUS community, to work closely with professors that will go beyond expectations to teach us, and to share my life with brilliant students who possesses a similar passion for learning, while we nurture each other’s personal growth. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Why try something new?

I’m an alchemist, born with a mission to gather all the ingredients for the Magical Stone—an elixir that will transform my humanly life to historical immortality, a catalyst that will turn my short existence into an eternal legacy. But I’ve never been told exactly what these ingredients are, so I have to spend my life discovering the solution to this  ;alchemy. Ever since I was conscious of my mission, I’ve been puzzling over the secret. Is it  ;mercury? Is it sulfur? Or is it basalt? ;When a new material grabs my attention, I will store it in my satchel. Is it the ingredients? I don’t know. Luckily though, I’m not entirely clueless. I can tell immediately just by casting the new material into my smelter, and observing how it melds with the base element—my talent. Without ever losing faith in my mission, I have been collecting ingredients for 17 years.  ;I once saw a master playing the flute in a music hall. I was so impressed by the melody that I implored the master to mentor me. Naturally, I wished to incorporate the beautiful melody of this apparatus into my magical stone. Under the mentorship of the master, I practiced everyday, persevering despite already missing the best era for learning the flute; I was already fifteen, and my lung’s capacity was almost fixed. For two years I spent my leisure time playing the flute, enjoying the mellifluous music that I produced. ;Then somehow, I found that advancing my skills became difficult. It wasn’t like solving math problems or running track; it wasn’t even like playing my other instrument, Zheng. I found it hard to excel in playing flute, so that no matter how hard I tried, I still couldn’t control my breath as perfectly as my peers, nor catch the nuance of trill. That moment, I understood that the flute will forever be a peripheral component of my magical stone, not a key ingredient. ;Was I frustrated by this reality? Not in the slightest. I might not get to play flute in Carnegie Hall in my lifetime, but I can choose from numerous other orchestras to perform with in college and beyond. This twoIyear experiment was an inspiring ingredient that galvanized my love for music and deepened my understanding of myself. At every chance, I will continue to seize new ingredients without hesitation, whether it is a new instrument or a bold interdisciplinary research opportunity. My instinct tells me that I should never stop in my exploration, excavation, and discovery. Only by doing so will I be worthy of my role as an alchemist. ;"

    "CommonApp": "The spring of 1998 AD marks the grand navigation of Admiral Ashley to this New World. The Ashlian settlement befallen on the far east of the Asian continent. As a witness for 17 years, I am going to unfold you a picture of this wonderful country.Ashley is a joyous republic composed of three main states.Imagination state, the oldest state in the country, is the origin of Ashlian culture. In the center of the state is the Imagination Volcano. Every time it erupts, flowery literature and art pieces cover every corner. The seeds of Western literature and art were sowed on the arable land of the state, irrigated from the Lake of Greek mythology. The strong female role of Athena was favored over ancient Chinese lore praising females for being fragile, soft, and reserved. This state also underwent a period of Renascence in the arts—paintings of Forest Elves and ancient Chinese gentries cover the city walls. Ashlians especially enjoyed transcribing Japanese light poetry and Chinese proverbs, which have shaped the writing styles of modern Ashlians. Middle School Ages passed with an emergence of scientific knowledge; that was when the state of Curiosity burgeoned. Curiosity and eagerness prompted early scientists to sink the country in knowledge. Prompted by the favor of science, the country welcomed the AP Act, which encouraged Ashlians to pursue abstruse foreign physics and mathematic tools. These activities introduced the nation to algorithms and computer science.The seed of enlightenment then germinated, triggered by a foreign book, The Age of Reason. Ashlians were deeply amazed by the power of pure reason, as Paine calls, “the gift by God”. From then on, Ashlians shifted their interest to argumentative essays.Introduction of The Prince promoted a moral revolution in the country. Machiavelli argues that virtues, generosity and bountiful kindness should be replaced by shrewdness. Although Ashlians did not fully agree with the shocking views presented in the book, they realized the limit of morals, which leads to the need of laws to reinforce rules in a society. They turned to articles and TV shows about judicial logic and legal principles to strengthen their acceptance of laws into the land.The final, Criticism State encouraged its citizens to debate with each other whenever an issue arose. Foreign ideas and outside help were imported from sites like Quora. Contradictory point of views increased domestic production of criticism so that consumers gained better ability to discern the quality of imported ideas. One thing this nation will always be proud of is that her citizens will always have independent opinions.The influence of these historical periods all remains encoded in the genes of Ashlians. Curiosity of knowledge, fondness of art, admiration for reason and science, and the ability to think for themselves are integral characteristics of this country. Ashlians appreciate the simple beauties in life—daydreaming is not a sin; singing out loud in public is mandatory; they are easily filled with awe. Ashlians love science and knowledge—they do not believe in the existence of “useless” knowledge; they appreciate the color change in test tubes as much as myths about the Burmuda Triangle.Also, Ashlians think about the world—this is a thoughtful nation that advocates awareness about current news such as war refugees and fluctuation in markets; this nation considers it necessary to ponder its own history of formation and to look forward into its future path of development.   As aspiring as Ashlians are, they found that the current Ashlian settlement is not enough to satisfy their adventurous spirit and hunger for knowledge. Now, a team of adventurers is preparing to settle on another continent for some years, to further explore the world in honor of their country. Hope you, my dear reader, can permit our adventurers to settle and flourish on your rich territory, where more ideas await.",

Then Siri came along, which helped me make up my mind to study computer science, to explore the subject of artificial intelligence. ;I am delighted to find that eagerness for studying is welcomed and supported by NYU Tan-don School of Engineering. Through the accelerated BS/MS program, taking graduate level courses before I even receive a bachelor degree means that I could start learning artificial intelligence early. With the help from the Polytechnic Tutoring Center (PTC), one of the most comprehensive tutoring services that even include help from faculty members, I believe I can complete the basic foundation courses in computer science ahead of schedule. After I acquired a solid knowledge basis in these courses, I would like to take graduate courses such as Artificial Intelligence (CS-GY 6613), in which I can learn how to make a program think like a human, and create something like Siri. ;Furthermore, NYU also can help me to start career preparation early by providing opportunities in research and design for undergraduate students. Through design project courses, I can find and work with a mentor also interested in AI design who may teach me more practical experiences in AI projects not written in textbooks, such as the most efficient procedures to start a research and the mindset of computer scientists. ;Research groups like CILVR would allow me to study machine learning, a basic but important component in AI design. CILVR seminars will allow me to learn knowledge that can be applied to real optimization and engineering design problems in transportation, image classification, and more. Supported by the Dean’s undergraduate research fund, I can do research on campus with a group of undergraduate students during summer vacation.Whether it is the curriculum or the extracurricular resources, at NYU, I will have plenty of opportunities to do real projects and research so that I can apply the knowledge learned in class in practical use, and prepare for professional engagement in AI upon graduation."

    "CommonApp": "Ah, spotlight! --- The one and only thing that allows a powerful desire to express myself. My classmates and teachers do not naturally associate me with a huge fan of public speaking, since I am usually regarded as a typical science geek. Science geeks, stereotypically, are supposed to be reserved, timid and introverted. However, to be honest, it is the most relaxing moment for me to express myself freely under the spotlight, under the gaze of others.I started to speak in public when I was in junior high school. I was so deeply fascinated with a traditional art drama, called Hua Ji Xi, which originated from my hometown, Shanghai. Hua Ji Xi applied different dialects and represented a form of art that was on the edge of extinction. Collecting the dialects from different regions; imitating the accent as well as overcoming the nervous and restless feelings while I perform, became the three major difficulties on my way to perform Hua Ji Xi in front of more than a thousand audiences at school. Laughter, applause, smiling faces --- I almost felt dizzy under the spotlight watching the reactions of the audiences. I had never expected that words and performance could be so powerful. In the following months, I gathered some of my classmates and performed Broadway Shows Out of Order, music drama The Lion King and drama from Carlo Goldoni Servant of Two Masters. I could not resist but fell in love with the stage and spotlight.I went to looking for my spotlight after attending high school. This time, I was standing in front of the rostrum and addressing speeches for emotional resonance instead of merely laughter and applause. By chance, I met the president of an elite charity club in China called Rotary International, which rooted in the United States. I was deeply impressed by the mission of this club and decided to establish our own Interact Club, which was part of the Rotary for teenagers at my high school. With endless publicity campaigns and speeches, more than five hundred fellow schoolmates joined me and my Interact Club. Here, I have successfully established the largest school-based Interact Club in China. Now I am standing in front of the rostrum, firmly introducing what we have done in the Interact Club and where we are heading in the future. From then on, public speaking was no longer simply a way to fulfill myself as a performer to receive acknowledgement and appreciation from my audiences, but more of a powerful way to express myself, to make good differences in my community, even tiny ones. Spotlight, a beam to guide me towards my passion and beliefs; a power for me to lead and go further beyond.",

    "CommonApp": "Sipping my black tea with its sprinkle of chili, I ran through my mental checklist of the next 24 hours. First, I'd report to the play's director in the morning, make pastries at a bakery in the afternoon, and then prepare dinner according to my new recipe (which I call a 3D dinner) for my family. After dinner, I'd rush off to another city on a late night train, then finally use a new song I recorded to greet the rising sun the next day. This would be just another typical day in the life of me. Every day must be fresh, so I always combine seemingly contradictory elements: scrambled eggs+ Coke=something my parents refused to eat, DIY sneakers+ different paints=my signature shoes 1.0, a shower cubicle+ soundproof equipment=my recording studio, birthday gifts+ clues in Morse code=a weeklong mission for my classmate. Wait! Speaking about equations, what is the recipe of myself? People say I fail somewhere between passion and madness, but while this characteristic may be the appetizer, every recipe should be based around the entrée. For the meat, I'd have to choose the self-reliance I gained through struggling with the solitude of the tennis court. How? By lining up Coke cans and trying to hit ten out of ten. I later found that I'd not only have to train but also fight alone. During a match I'll always remember, my opponent's supporters made the most of their home court advantages by flooding the arena with boos for every mistake I made. Knowing the tennis court is a place where we never have a teammate to cheer for us after a good save or comfort us after a missed shot, I fought back. Despite still losing the game, I earned applause from my opponent and the audience. Therefore, this entrée is made from endurance, sprinkled with a positive determination to fight alone, and roasted under the pressure of a 36.60m by 18.30m tennis court. For flavoring, I like to choose subtle condiments that aren't too overpowering or tasteless. Through another important activity in my life, acting, I've become sensitive to the subtle differences of even the most intense emotions. Wiping away silent tears, quarreling tensely, falling to my knees while laughing like a lunatic before going off on a hysterical rant... Wait, is that really me? At that moment, I couldn't really tell, because I was caught up playing Truman in our performance of the Truman Show—the most emotionally complicated character I've ever played. The sourness, bitterness, spiciness and sweetness of the lives I experience on stage gives my own life a distinct flavor. Acting is like a dish layered with flavors: bitterness first hits my lips before combining, expanding, and deepening into many diverse aromas. Through performing on stage, I've also learned to share the spotlight. The first play I was in, I complained about my tiny part, which only had two lines of script. But just like Japanese Sukiyaki, in which a dozen different sauces are combined, only through a good dynamic with the supporting actors can the entire cast display the correct emotions. What's more, I'm no longer nervous of big audiences. Possibly because I go crazy on stage every time, but more likely because I know I'm not fighting alone. So does that mean my life=self-reliance from tennis+ sensitivity to subtleties and cooperation on stage? No. My life always has an X. If the recipe of my life were a cup of tea, then this X is the chili that makes it different. Everyone wants to change the world. Microsoft updates their systems every other year, Apple updates their cell phones every year, and what about me? I unveil a new \"me\" everyday, thus changing the world with an updated version of myself. I'm running out of spicy black tea, but don't worry. Maybe tomorrow I'll create a new menu with a refreshed X.",

Without hesitation, we rushed to the station, desperately hoping to catch the last shuttle to the top. “Six tickets please.” “Sorry, only three left.” “What?” These words lit up the blunderbuss. “Maybe three of us should go.” “You selfish thing! Where is our companionship?” “Fine, what about renting a car?” “Forget it! Already run out of money.” “Oh, come on! We just missed it like this.” ;The last shuttle left during the argument and people went back, downhearted, until late that night I shouted like a lunatic, “Folks, let’s go now!” Putting the sleepy guys onto the six bicycles I rented, I made our journey continue. All the speed and climbing races along with flirts and jokes in heavy rain demonstrated that the craziness paid off. Sitting side by side, we all witnessed the most splendid sunrise in our lives, the one belonging to brotherhood. Indeed, I belong to a crazy group of six, and the companionship we’ve formed during our various trips is the best adhesive. Each of us has a different role in the group. Personally, I tend to be the atmosphere coordinator, the crazy solution creator, and the one who won’t let anything impede my craziness and adventures.Sometimes the things I treat as common were regarded as ‘unreasonably’ crazy by others, as it is when I transformed Lays tins into studios, put a message bottle into East China Sea to see if it could flow back to me 20 years later, or tried to draw my dreams down and publish the pictures. On the other hand, sometimes I can find the ‘unreasonably’ craziness out of the common things taken for granted by others.Randomly picking up a common bottle for water, I found that the water bottle is conveniently designed for right-handed people. Then I rushed to my room just to find out the mouse was also designed for right-handed people and felt awkward in my left hand’s grasp. What’s more, that indifferent cursor on my computer always pointed to the upper-left corner for right-handed people’s convenience, reminding me that the left-handed were doomed for inconvenience. From then I realized that however devotedly our world take care of minorities, there is always minorities of the minorities, the ignored who wage a silent struggle. If I wanted to help the left-handed minority, I had to raise awareness first. Co-organizing Left-handers’ Day in the community, I advocated rights for lefties, and more minorities. Our community witnessed a crazy tide of parties for lefties, which all came from a common water bottle in my hand.When others think I get lost, only I myself know that I am more stuck to myself. Just as a magnet needs both a positive pole and a negative pole to be complete, the world needs both common and the crazy poles to be complete. I feel fortunate to stand for the crazy pole of the world."

    "CommonApp": "I’ve always loved science. I loved geology because it tells the history of the earth, biology because it explores the secrets of living creatures, chemistry because it contains the mysteries of chemical properties, and physics because it illustrates the forces of life. And yet, I could never understand why we were forced to study mathematics.Why should I recite and answer these insipid questions? It seemed like all these formulas were the same, especially when they could be solved with a calculator within a second! All I wanted to do was throw my mathematics homework aside, and go to the pond in my compound. There my friends and I would play “ducks and drakes,” vying to skip a flat stone the greatest number of times along the water’s surface. The pavilion in the center of the pond was my kingdom, because I had been the best shooter, but things changed when Iris moved to town. I lost my crown.As a teenager, I found it difficult to face such competition. It seemed impossible to surpass Iris’ record of twelve skips, but I was determined. Searching online, I was amazed to find that an association for ducks and drakes even existed. Furthermore, I found out that the world record was eighty-eight skips. Aha! So Iris’ record was nothing; I could break it. However, all my previous victories had been merely due to intuition; I’d need to turn to science this time. I’d need an equation.From my physics class, I knew I’d have to consider the texture and shape of the stones, the speed and angle at which I threw them, and many other factors. Through the long process of consulting books on theories of kinetic energy and damped vibration, I drew a step closer. After combining different formulas and considering various factors, I narrowed them down to three equations! I just needed to simplify these three into my own formula; success was right in front of me.Unfortunately, I couldn’t handle the trigonometric functions in order to complete the equation. The calculator kept giving me an irrational number like 0.2763846… How did these numbers help me simplify my equation? Suddenly, those “useless” mathematic techniques from class became important, so I sought help from Mr. Wang, my mathematics teacher. Knowing I didn’t like math, he’d help only if I promised to first review all we’d learned about trigonometric functions. I had no choice, if I wanted to figure out the knack of skipping stones.With some help from him, I finally got my equation: njumps=(V0^2x)/2αgl! It means I need to throw the stone as fast as possible and keep it parallel to the water. I found the trick! The stone jumped like there was a spring on it—a spring installed by my equation. One, two, three… Oh, how my heartbeat seemed to thump with each bounce. By the time I reached fourteen jumps, I couldn’t believe that I’d hated this amazing subject! And although I still can’t break the world record, I’m once again the “stone queen” in my neighborhood. I get my crown back!I now see the magic of mathematics everywhere. When introduced to a new friend at a party and he turns out to be an old acquaintance, I’m inspired to read about Ramsay Theory; when I play cards, game theory helps increase my chances of winning; when my mother wants to buy a new house, I can help her evaluate the differences between repayment and interest-only mortgages.John von Neumann said, “If people don’t believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they don’t realize how complicated life is.” But I prefer to say, “If people think life is too complicated, it is only because they don’t know mathematics.” I now love mathematics as more than just a tool; I love mathematics because it’s an art.",

No one shares as close a relationship with the floor as us. Each morning starts off when I arrive at school at six-thirty with the mist, the chirps, and the sound of my black knee protectors hitting the floor. Having played since eighth grade, the No. 8 subway line has witnessed my forearm go through changes, from white and delicate to bronzed and muscular. However, volleyball has had a profounder effect than just teaching me persistence. The volleyball court is the perfect stage to reinforce the bedrock of cooperation: trust.Without trust, we’ll fear conflicts, and at crucial junctures, such as when we’re discussing tactics, we’ll only have a superficial consensus among the team. I love catching my teammates eye in a competition; I love anticipating the first serve of the game; I love when my teammates commend me as a setter; I love the powerful spike of the main attacker; and I love our team’s cheer after making a point. However, all of these fantastic moments can’t happen without cooperation. There is Lew Androski who scored 5 points in nine minutes, and T-mac who made 13 points in thirty-five seconds. But there will never be a volleyball player who scores so many points and wins the game on their own.Volleyball is not just a sport I enjoy but also an unshakable part of my life."

    "CommonApp": "Pop! I stab the straw through the plastic film. My favorite bubble tea is a little odd—a mixture of green tea, jasmine flowers and red beans. Unlike the common combination of milk tea with tapioca pearls, the consummate representative of bubble tea, this \"greenish-yellow liquid blended with crimson beans\" is simply bizarre. \"Why do you like it, anyway?\" my friend asked.I smiled, thinking, it is so much more than just tea. As I begin sipping, my first taste is of roasted green tea and brewed jasmine flowers, bitter. Chewing the beans that have traveled up the straw and into my mouth, I am delighted by the burst of penetrating sweetness when one is split open. I hold one particularly sweet red bean in my heart: singing. Born without a \"voice of gold,\" my enthusiasm for music is inexplicable—I sang off-tune as a child, but stubbornly insisted that the vocal genes I inherited from my Henan-opera-singing grandmother would one day surface. Although my parents constantly recounted my first singing performance in which the pitches coming out of my mouth were completely out of place, I ignored their description and savored my enthusiasm. Yes, it seemed I lacked natural talent. But whenever I was free I would still click a song, put on my headphones, and practiced singing to my computer. As I recorded my music, listening to the playback, I closed my eyes and imagined myself standing on a stage. For many years, my dream had remained distant. The headphones stayed over my ears, until I bumped into an announcement seeking performers for a free neighborhood show. I registered with ecstasy and a little self-doubt. Finally standing on stage, the music seemed more real than ever. Looking at the supportive young and old, I was convinced: even as amateur as I was, the bittersweet process, like the taste of my bubble tea, nurtured a different happiness, an \"unconditional love\" for music in the simplest, most proactive way—just singing out. By the time my tea is half consumed, with a swift stir, the bitter-sweet distinction is blurred as the tea and beans interweave. The coalition of tea and beans finally leads to a new enlightenment, urging me to connect the \"cultural dots\" that enthralled me on a new stage. Every Chinese New Year, \"Xiang Sheng\" Chinese cross-talks and comedy dramas are broadcasted nationally, showcasing this traditional form of Chinese comedy art. Although the shows are constantly forgotten when the New Year fervor dissipates, my interest in this tradition, rooted in the rich variety and historical depth into the intonations, dialects, and cultural knowledge in the performances, remains. As a dweller of a new metropolis, somewhat disconnected from my hometown, I often seek paths leading back to my cultural heritage. I began to wonder: Why not perform myself? This question encouraged me to take the stage again. During one show in school, I performed passionately, switching from a Liaoning dialect to a Hunan accent. I saw that students of diverse origins in different provinces in China, responded with laughs and knowing smiles as they heard familiar tones. I realized that I cherished this art just like I cherished my bubble tea. Whereas both are wide confluences of different elements, by performing and hence forging the community together, I paid my fondness for the tea forward. Why do I persistently favor green tea mixed with jasmine flowers and red beans? Ultimately, I believe that my enthusiasm is for the splendor inside the drink's unusual taste and appearance: the bitter-sweetness of my music, the mixed dialects in the cross talk shows, and most significantly, the stories that compose who I am. Whenever I carry this beverage, I am in fact carrying an indispensable part of my personality - my unwavering belief in unlimited possibilities. I will keep stirring, swirling and sipping—hoping to see what stories can be added to my life, to my bubble tea.",

    "CommonApp": "Since I have been living in a city with more than 20M population since birth, I have long wondered how the city functions orderly. Therefore, it wasn’t surprising that I chose to do a project about urban planning when I entered high school. At that time, the concept of “urban planning” to me was similar to “data analysis”, so I believed that by the simple idea of collecting data and then processing it, I could reach the conclusion I needed. Actually, that is exactly the way I worked on the project in the first place. I decided to research on the living, especially walking patterns of senior citizens in one specific neighborhood. Everything I needed to fully understand it is the velocity, location of my subjects and their evaluation of the neighborhood, and all of them can be acquired with some short field work. Therefore, I set out to the neighborhood to conduct my work, and that is when my entire comprehension about urban planning, or even scientific research, started to change.It was a hot summer day with few pedestrians on the road, but I was well-prepared for such situations. In fact, I’ve imagined all kinds of unexpected cases, such as no one was willing to take the GPS device with them, or some of them answered my survey question but paid no attention, but what surprised was that actually I didn’t use any of the excuses I prepared to persuade them. Every time I stopped one senior citizen to ask them for a favor very carefully, not only would they agree to help without much hesitation, they also raised some questions that even me, the initiator and the conductor of the project, had never thought about. What result INDEED do I want to achieve by completing this project? Will there be any real change to the community? If not, what is the point of researching on it? What I discovered is that they, as the residents here, don’t care about how I analyze the case or whether this project creates a useful method in urban planning study; instead, the reason why they agreed to help is that they sincerely hope that my work could make some improvements, even the slightest. But what did I think? Ironically, I never intended to make an improvement plan, and were it not for them, it was very likely that my study would end with my analysis of the data I collected and some idealistic conclusions which had no influence to reality. Although with their cooperation, it didn’t take me much time to finish my task, but on my way back home, I had to rethink about the future of my project. Is a project that was entirely theoretical and had no actual applications something I want?It didn’t take me much time to have an answer.No.I started to re-plan my whole project; the data, the analysis, they are important, but still, they are merely one small step in the project. I had to make a plan that could improve the situation with the highest efficiency, and of course, could be applied to reality. To be specific, I needed to do more detailed surveys, I needed to go way deeper into the community, and I needed to observe it with a more anthropological perspective rather than a statistical one. When I finally took my improvement plan with me to talk to the community administration organization, I could see appreciation in their eyes, appreciation that a high school student could do research for the satisfaction of the world, instead of his own. Indeed, all the scientific researches, together pave a road to harmony of nature, to economic advance, to cultural diversity, and more importantly, to a near future full of expectations. I would call the path I experienced a road of social care for humans.",

For my project, I focused on the topic of the “home range” of senior citizens since aging is a very serious problem in this society. During this period, I started to understand that urban design was excitingly complicated, and requires both skills in statistics and also an understanding of the people that inhabit cities. For example, I had a breakthrough by using GPS devices to track the routes of senior citizens. This provided an empirical method to identify problematic roads in order to make informed improvements. Then, determined to submit recommendations to local committees, I found it necessary to incorporate the history and cultural background of residents. Ultimately, my urban studies project expanded my horizons and leads me follow the principle of being comprehensive. That’s the reason why I select urban studies as my concentration.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Community\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          My modeling contest team is one of the teams that give me sense of belonging.

    "CommonApp": "I am the Durian Queen. My mom, like many people, never liked durians. She doesn’t hide her disgust whenever she sees me eating it or wandering around durian stands at the market. She would frown, “It’s bulky, smelly, and covered by thorns.” In order to defend my favorite fruit, I once stared at a durian, trying to think of its positive points (and whether its points were a positive trait). I noticed its husk is tough yet its flesh soft; its repugnant odor doesn’t deter people whom like it from eating it. I was not simply looking at a fruit, but realizing something much more important about myself as a leader.As courage and toughness are required to lead, the hard tusk of a durian serves to demonstrate to people its force. Durian, while nutritional, also has other applications: its husk can be made into paper (via coir fiber) or used as natural mosquito repellent; its seeds pound into durian flour and chips. Like a durian, a leader must appear strong, convincing herself and others of her ability, and dedicate every bit of herself to maximizing the team’s benefit. My confidence as a leader was tested when my gymnastics team and I were competing in a national championship. Before our performance, one of my teammates hesitantly came to tell me that she was having a serious headache. Because I was nervous and unsure about our first national competition, instead of trying to negotiate with the staff to postpone, I encouraged her to do her best. During our performance she ended up falling down on stage. I allowed my fear and uncertainty to hinder my ability as a leader, and most importantly, I failed to protect my group member. Learning from my mistake, I started to build up my skills as a leader by being more determined and decisive. As Secretary General of MUN, I made sure to project confidence. After all, a durian’s formidable thorn-covered husk is not supposed to intimidate people, but instead to establish an impression of authority. When the tough tusk of a durian is opened, the soft and sweet flesh is visible. Similarly, when members of my club learn more about me, they find that though I appear tough, I am also friendly and willing to help whenever they ask me for advice. A leader is only as strong as the people she leads; so in order to lead well, she must support her team. A durian, with its strong odor, receives both criticism and resentment from many who regard it as a “low-class, stinky” fruit, similar to how sometimes my effort might not be understood, my decisions criticized, and my management questioned. A leader must always consider the goal of the group, as opposed to worrying about how well liked she is. Once, my friend was angry with me for publically criticizing her late arrival to rehearsal, but I did not show that it bothered me. Later, when I asked some team members, they agreed that the strict rules were ensuring the efficiency of rehearsal for everyone to save time. Blame is unavoidable, but it can also be beneficial, since it urges me to constantly introspect on my words, and decisions. Like how a person who ignores the odor of a durian will be able to enjoy its sweet flesh, a leader who understands the inevitability of blame, criticisms and misfortunes will be able to see the benefits it brings. Under the cover of a tough husk and thorns, I learn to be responsible, determined, and courageous. Resembling the soft sweet flesh of a durian, my friendly personality helps me get along with and understand my team members more. Shakespeare once wrote, “uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.” I suspect he knew that the Durian is sometimes referred to as the king of fruits.",
    "Supps": "题目：Why Penn\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          8:00 a.m., April 10, 2018, on my bed on the third floor of Riepe, sipping a cup of tea, I imagine myself wearing a black suit, cross-examining a witness. Having just declared my major in political science, I can see my remaining two years at Penn devoted to law school preparation, yet choosing the right courses is still a troubling task for me. ;Recalling my past two years, my involvements in the Penn community and academics have undoubtedly helped me become well versed in an array of fields. From sociology to performing arts courses, my experiences and professors have helped me to become more determined. With my potential major in mind, I enrolled in Poverty and Inequality in order to acquire a more comprehensive understanding of social justice and the role of laws in alleviating social problems. Discussing topics like poverty trends, labor markets, and anti-poverty policy programs in a small class setting, I not only gained a more personal relationship with Professor Regina Baker but also learned more about social inequality issues from a multitude of perspectives. In Rehearsal and Performance I learned through reading, improvisation, and scene study to improve my observation, cooperation, and communication skills. By studying acting techniques, reading the works of theorists, and practicing public speaking, I became a more confident storyteller. Hoping to develop my voice as a writer as well, I took Finding Voice: Perspectives on Race, Class and Gender. Through interviews, research, and writing exercises, I was able to not only use the conventions of academic writing to convey my opinions with my own voice, but also discover more about the issues and inquiries of minority groups. ;My learning at Penn also occurred outside the classroom. For a more direct approach to alleviating inequality issues, I joined Empty the Shelters to support the \"poor people's economic human rights campaign\" through direct work with the poor and by building a broad-based movement to end poverty. Our efforts focused on educating students and supporting the work of the Kensington Welfare Rights Union. Additionally, as a freshman excited about exchanging ideas, I joined both Penn Model Congress (PENNMC) and Penn Speech and Debate. PENNMC enhanced my understanding of American government, especially Congress and the legislative process, while Penn Speech Debate's varsity members taught me how to conduct parliamentary and policy debate. Watching the seniors competing in NFA-LD college circuit was an inspiring experience, as I learned more about different debating styles and improved my critical thinking, researching, and speaking skills. ;The tea has grown cold. I continue to meditate on my future choices. Browsing through names and descriptions of the courses, I can't make up my mind. Among copious courses within the Department of Political Science, Human Rights appeals to me, since the intricate relationship between the need of human beings and the development of law has always been the focus of the legislative process. Discussions on civil rights and women's rights can provide me with a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of public opinion on politics and laws. American Constitutional Law II also intrigues me, as I have grown curious about constitutional developments and the history of the struggles for equal rights. Furthermore, the instructor, Professor Rogers Smith, has interests that match my own: public law, civil rights, and political thought. With his help, I will develop a keen awareness about the rights of the disadvantaged and the further legislative effort required for the pursuit of equality. ;Engagement promotes progress, not only on the stage of politics but also in law. Looking forward to my next two years at Penn, I feel confident that I'm gradually being prepared for future studies in law school. More importantly, with my general education background and upcoming major courses, I know I will build up a sense of social responsibility, gain comprehensive awareness of global issues, and acquire a deeper insight into policy building and implementation. ;"

    "CommonApp": "My world is in a vintage Chinese wooden bookcase, basking in the sunshine of our apartment’s veranda. Those books form the world that helped me dream of exploring and making new discoveries in various fields of science, especially physics. It all began the summer after second grade. One hot day, I sat outside with the fan in front of me. My eyes started to wander around to find something interesting, and they landed on the bookcase. It was my father’s and the books were advanced, so I usually didn’t pay much attention to it. But this time, I noticed a dusty brown leather box placed at the bottom shelf. It piqued my curiosity. When I opened it, I was surprised to find notes for a physics class in my father’s clear handwriting. Excitedly, I pulled my chair close to the bookcase and began reading. Unlike those textbooks whose language is didactic and boring, my father’s notebook contained his own personal interpretation towards concepts. Seeing the way he solved questions and even sometimes had mistakes made me feel more closer to the notebook, and as I kept reading, I felt opened a new world filled with physics concepts. Though difficult, the contents were interesting enough for me to read with great patience I never had before. The development of astronomy, Newton’s era, and all those theories immediately made me curious to better understand the world. Besides the joy of exploring new knowledge, the subject also impressed me with its inherent logic and precise computation, All those scrupulous solutions to comprehend and analyze phenomena dwarfed my childish, random ways of thinking. Even if I didn’t understand a lot of what I read, that first impression paved a strong foundation for my love of science. Later, I started to spend a lot of my spare time sitting beside bookcase. I sat in my own world in that small corner of the veranda, learning interesting things I wouldn’t have been able to in class. The book Make: Electronics Learning by Discovery, for example, let me get a hands-on interpretation towards modern technology. I enjoyed experiments like making my own primitive lemon battery to light up several LEDs. Though honestly I wasted a lot of lemons, it made life more interesting for me.Through the years, the world of my father’s books helped me find and pursue my love for science. In college, I wish to further explore those appealing fields, especially physics. In the future, maybe I can apply the theories I learn to modern technologies, or do further research in areas like quantum mechanics. Although I’ll leave that vintage bookcase behind one day, with all my father’s books, the inspiration I got there will still remain.",

It has helped me become a stronger person, always ready to face my problems directly.When I first heard of aerobics in middle school, I was immediately attracted by the vigorous attitude of the dance and the group members. Later, as the leader, I was proud to help everyone prepare for important competitions, whether it was teaching them how to feel the music or remember all the patterns or bringing them together like a family. However, outside of the team I wasn’t as confident.Early in middle school, a few classmates started making fun of my reading. \"Look, she's reading Scarlet Letter! Isn't she pretentious? I don't believe people can enjoy reading those boring novels.\"I told myself the comments would go away if I just ignore them. But they continued until slowly, all my classmates started to isolate me. During this time, I devoted myself even more into aerobics, my refuge. With my welcoming teammates and the energetic music surrounding me, I felt like I could do anything.Then on Sports Day in 8th grade, I got excited when a classmate invited me to attend the competitions, thinking maybe they wanted to fix the problems and to be friends again. Brimming with excitement, I sat among my classmates on the bleachers as they discussed the day's competitions. For the first time in a while, I found the confidence to speak up, but immediately they stopped their conversation, acting as if I was a stranger. How embarrassed I felt.I rushed out of school as fast as I could, running until I arrived home. Turning on the tap and let the water cool my face, I felt a little better.With a clear head, I asked myself: Against the bullies, why couldn't I be the same person as in aerobics, so energetic and charismatic? At that moment, I made a decision to live in a new way.I reminded myself that I was a confident leader, and finally confronted those classmates who made hurtful remarks. We held a conversation and I was surprised to find out that at first they wanted to interact with me more, but when they saw that I ignored them, their comments became hurtful. When I told them how I felt, they started to regret what they did, and even apologized. Although we never became very close, we started getting along better over the next year. Other classmates also felt more comfortable talking to me in class, and my school life improved. Most importantly, it was so simple.My experience taught me that difficulties only fester when I leave them alone, and that I must actively challenge them instead. Aerobics helped me discover my positive and energetic self, and reminds me not to let fear and difficulties turn me into a shy individual. Today, I am more outspoken and expressive than ever: I love telling interesting stories and sharing in the new friendly atmosphere with my classmates. With the active attitude I got from aerobics, I am now brave enough to triumph over obstacles as I strive after my goals in life."

That elegant handwriting with its clear train of thoughts excited me and made me start to spend lots of spare time reading through all. From the primitive exploration of astronomy to the operation theories of modern technologies, my father’s personal interpretation of physics concepts and his way of solving problems opened a new world for me. Through that notebook, for the first time I heard the concept of microcosms, worlds that cannot be observed directly by human eyes. Though difficult, I read with great patience I never had before and asked my father lots of questions about what I read. ;While learning about concepts like Maxwell’s equations, I discovered that the field I was interested in is called quantum mechanics, and it covers what cannot even be explained by classic physics. Really curious to learn more, I kept reading and discovered that study of these things that couldn’t be seen had actually been applied to many accomplishments in real world: 50 years ago, the first transistor was invented based on its knowledge. Then, the super precise clock, quantum cryptography and laser beam all appeared subsequently, thus improving the progress of humans’ living conditions. Excited about this amazing field and its potential in real world, I decided on my goal of studying quantum mechanics in-depth and applying its special principles, such as uncertainty, interference and entanglement, into modern technology. ;In CMU’s supportive environment, with the impressive physics department I can not only study advanced theories of quantum mechanics but also learn more about its experiments and applications. Classes in the computational physics track will allow me to use computers to effectively simulate and study the movement of those tiny particles that otherwise are invisible and unpredictable to humans. When I have questions about this complex subject, the Academic Development program also can provide me support from helpful peers with walk-in tutoring or the EXCEL study groups. With these great programs I can not only learn well but also join the passionate community of science students at CMU.Once I have mastered class materials, by joining research projects at the DarkLab, I can get an even deeper understanding of the features that intrigue me through helpful experiments. There I’ll further my understanding about things like the spin of quantum and its relationship with gravitational field. Using all this knowledge, I can help do further research in fields like Quantum Communication, which can connect humans across the world immediately, at the Pittsburgh Research Center. By deepening my knowledge in quantum mechanics through these special and advanced research opportunities at CMU, I will have a good foundation to one day do my own research promoting the development of useful modern technologies.With a minor in CS at Carnegie Mellon, I can achieve additional depth and breadth in the field of quantum mechanics. Courses such as Computer Graphics will teach me how to create and manipulate even better visualizations of data, an essential part of quantum research. By following the guidance of distinguished professors, using programs I can even trace the tracks of invisible particles or establish the ideal environment for experiments.I would fully utilize the valuable resources provided by Carnegie Mellon to further explore application of various physics theories. In the future, by using technology to advance in the field of quantum mechanics, I hope to help in discoveries that will make the world become more convenient and progressive."

    "CommonApp": "“Becoming Untagged”Shanghai was just a forty-five-minute bus ride away from Songjiang, the suburb where I grew up, but to me it was like a different world. After my weekly English and piano lessons, I’d explore the city’s bustling streets, marveling at the eclectic mix of Western cafes, modern high-rises, and Chinese teahouses in the French Concession.  But inevitably, the crowds of indifferent strangers would begin to intimidate me and my excitement would drain away. I’d become self-conscious, awkwardly trying to imitate the city-dwellers’ manners and attitudes, but feeling like a tourist inside.  With a sigh, I’d head for the bus station for the ride home.These weekly bus rides came to a halt after my family moved into an apartment downtown. Finally, I could say I lived in the real Shanghai. Yet even so, I still found myself emphasizing my outsider status. I attributed my poor math scores to the fact that I didn’t grow up with a math tutor like my classmates. When I won an English competition, I’d congratulate myself as the suburban underdog who’d outperformed the city kids.  I thought this way until sixth grade, when I volunteered to be the English class representative. Having to collect homework and assist the teacher forced me to talk to the classmates I had worked so hard to keep at a distance. To help one classmate out, I started making him a weekly quiz that many other students also ended up taking over our lunch break. During one session, I met Victor and learned about his interest in drama. I invited him to be my partner for the school’s dubbing competition. To my surprise, I found that he was from Songjiang too. In fact, when I was signing a student information form, I realized that many of my “urban” classmates were also from other provinces.  It gradually became clear to me that my classmates were individuals, with their own stories and identities. Why, I wondered, had I been so quick to lump them under one “tag”? For that matter, why had I been so quick to tag myself as an outsider, when no one really treated me as one? I began to realize that it wasn’t my classmates’ fault that I felt like a “suburban girl.” In my insecurity, I was the one who’d chosen to cling to this label.For the first time, I began to think of the person I had become in my community. I am the girl who is famous for being a nutrition nerd, sitting in the back row in order to secretly design nutrition courses with my deskmate, whom I instantly connected with when I learned about his involvement in diabetes education. I am the girl who is known for being cheerful and helpful, and yet always ends up playing the villain in our school dramas, whether it’s the sinister Lady Macbeth or a martinet of a Tiger Mother. I am the girl who gets nervous just making the daily announcements in my role as class monitor, yet who can’t wait to arrange a presentation of my pictures and thoughts from my vacation trip. I am the girl who stays up late studying, but spends the period before an exam lying on the grass with my best friend, staring up through the branches at the tranquil blue sky.      My identity card will always say “Songjiang” on it, but I now know that I am more than just an area code. I may never have a neat answer for the question, “Who am I?”  But I now understand that identity is self-defined, and self-directed. It’s only when we shed our “tags,” whether those of race, religion, or nationality, that we can truly embrace others and find our shared values. I look at myself and others without tags now, and I like what I see.",
    "Supps": "题目：How have your experiences influenced you to consider the College of Human Ecology and how will your choice of major impact your goals and plans for the future? (650)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          My interest in Nutritional Science was ignited by my ninth grade biology class, where I first learned about the digestive system and the mechanisms of heart disease. Fascinated by the consequences of unhealthy eating, I became further interested in Nutritional Science after learning about the effects of diet on epigenetics in the book “Survival of the Sickest.” My readings revealed to me the complex relationship between food and health, and convinced me to study nutrition formally in college.  ;Cornell’s CHE is my top choice for reasons beyond its rigorous scientific education. I spent three weeks at Martha Van Rensselaer Hall last summer, taking a course called “Body, Mind, and Health.” The lectures and readings about the different treatments for tuberculosis in male and female patients and the complex bio-psychosocial causes of anorexia nervosa gave me the mind-opening perspective that health issues go beyond pure biology. Attracted by the college’s interdisciplinary, holistic approach to health, I knew that CHE is where I want to be for the next four years.What specifically connects me to CHE and the Nutritional Science major is our shared belief that nutrition is a contemporary health challenge whose solutions require “making connections to creatively solve problems.” I’ve come to recognize that in China, my home country, there is little attempt to educate children about nutrition. Because I strongly believe that healthy eating habits must be taught and formed at a young age, I initiated a nutrition project in 10th grade. In addition to designing classes to teach kids basic nutritional facts, I wanted to try an interactive, artistic approach, since I suspected that kids would learn better as active participants than as passive listeners. Therefore, I designed creative activities, which ranged from drawing a “Nutrition Man” made of healthy foods to creating a comic strip about a family with unhealthy eating habits, for kids in different grades. Furthermore, I guided kids to apply their knowledge to their daily lives through activities such as creating a do-it-yourself salad with their parents. The results were encouraging: I watched as the kids took more active roles in food preparation at home and more responsibilities for their bodies. I’ve emerged from my project with the insight that kids learn best when placed at the center of their learning experience, and that ingenuity is an essential part of any successful nutrition project. Recognizing CHE’s same emphasis on the human experience and creative problem solving, I consider CHE the perfect place for me to continue fostering connections between food and people. ;In my future career, I want to focus on Nutrition Communications and Dietetics. Thus, I’ve decided to enter the Didactic Program in Dietetics to complement my primary course of study. Naturally, I will take courses like “Maternal and Child Nutrition” and “Nutrition and the Life Cycle,” within my major. I also plan to take advantage of CHE’s flexible curriculum to enroll in Human Development classes, to better understand learning mechanisms and decision making, essential components of developing effective nutrition education programs for children. CHE’s philosophy is that knowledge is meant to be applied, and I wholeheartedly agree: I therefore also intend to participate in hands-on projects, such as the Urban Semester in New York City.  ;Working with service programs such as Motivating Action through Community Health Outreach (MAChO) will allow me to promote healthy living among disadvantaged youths in North Brooklyn, thus directly impacting people’s lives.Ultimately, my goal is to have a positive impact on family health, using educational activities and expert advice to guide families to achieve healthy eating practices at home. I believe that an education at Cornell’s CHE will give me the ability to design solutions to help people live healthier and better lives."

    "CommonApp": "My dad is the son of a peasant. I am the daughter of a respectable physician. The worlds we come from couldn’t be more different, yet the way they affected us is remarkably similar.Growing up, I’d listen to stories of the poverty my dad experienced in that far-off village. “Back then,” my dad told me, “People would smash in the face of their own relative just for an egg to eat. They couldn’t see beyond the instant gains and opportunities in front of them.”Fortunately my dad was different. When his siblings quit school to work in the fields or factories, my dad borrowed loans to attend medical college in a distant city. Though lacking the formal education of many of his peers, he worked with the humble diligence of a countryman, and eventually went on to become an expert in his field, boldly introducing a new medical technology to his hospital. Even outside of work, he never fears experiencing challenges. In his thirties, he saw a golf club for the first time and fell in love with the sport. Though self-training plateaus sometimes made him want to throw his clubs away, he somehow managed to become an excellent amateur player. Similarly, two years ago he became interested in fitness. Though his fitness journey brought constant injuries and pains, he can now run a marathon and do 100 perfect push-ups. “Your dad’s a dreamer,” my mom concluded, “but he is stubborn enough to pull them through.”Influenced by my dad’s experiences and attitudes, I found myself inheriting his dreamer spirit. In China, where education is geared at vocational training, academic interests that don’t ensure a lucrative job are usually discouraged. Yet in spite of this environment, I somehow I gained a passion towards humanities and arts. I find joy in the subtle beauty of the rhyme and rhythm of 1900s Chinese novels. When studying World History,  I love combing over small facts and details in my efforts to understand unknown cultures and decipher historical trends. Some may say history and literature lack practicality, but I stubbornly believe humanities and arts are as valuable as STEM, and I long to continue studying this subject that gives us a better understanding of enigmatic human nature. With his resources, my dad could help provide me a promising career as a physician. Yet, whenever someone mentions this possibility, dad and I just glance at each other playfully, because we both realize our paths are parallel; they were never meant to intersect, always just a small distance apart, both guided by the same far-off destination—one full of unknowns—in pursuit of our dreams.I always marvel at the mystery of genetics, which buried identical core values beneath the different interests of dad and I. The two of us are willing to struggle on the path less traveled and ignore doubts and other’s expectations. With faith in our choices and sweat on our brows, we march forward in our ideal direction with a huge smile and endless determination.",

The breeze sweeps across my cheeks and my dark skin shines bronze in the sunlight. My body moves smooth and relaxed, each muscle stretched with elegance.I love these imaginations of running majestically in far off destinations. In reality though, I am a normal Chinese single child, having no connection with the wild women in my fantasy. Worse, I wasn’t even born athletic and only began running because of weight issues. However, this most basic activity unexpectedly became my greatest adventure.For a long period, running was a tough task for me. Each daily jog was a battle with the lazy girl inside me, and countless times I wanted to quit. Yet, acting as my own coach, I’d yell at myself, “Don’t stop! Keep going!” and would continue throwing my legs forward, cruelly but proudly.Over time though, the runs became easier. 5 km. 10 km. 15 km. Even after my original weight loss goal was achieved, I kept running. I would run in the summer though the fierce sunlight stabbing my skin, and through the biting winter winds that left my fingers chilled and frozen. ;Soon, I’d graduated from a little, shy fatty into someone fit, confident, and strong-minded. The conversations with myself while running were no longer intense quarrels, but resembled chats between old companions. The ache in my legs no longer made me feel desperation, and the heat burning my lungs didn’t result in thoughts of giving up. I learnt to not be afraid of being hurt and gained the bravery to challenge and try to surpass my limits.As a single child, I’d always lived in my comfort zone, like a potted plant neatly shaven and protected from bumps or bruises. I was groomed for a very predictable future: graduate from a decent Chinese university, enter a respectable local company, then work in the same position until I retire. I would live happily and easily. Yet, there would be nothing other than dinners and weekends to look forward to everyday, and eventually that bold, wild woman in my heart would weaken and wither away.Fortunately, I’ve begun to stretch out of the greenhouse, because by running, I’ve learned that some joys and achievements can’t be felt without pain, risks, or challenges. They are all nutrients that give the woman inside me the strength to passionately yell, “Go! Go sign up of a marathon and finish it strong. Go to another country and study the most challenging, interesting courses.  ;Go……” My heart beats fast for her words, yearning to experience all of those prodigious aches and joys.Honestly I’m still afraid of failures and obstacles. Yet I’ve gained courage to confront them, because deep in my soul there is a bold woman who can run to her destination through the pain, through the plains, through the hills, never stopping."

    "CommonApp": "Sometimes when jogging on the school tracks, I suddenly imagine myself as a wild woman running barefooted on an unbounded plain. The breeze sweeps gently across my cheeks, and my dark skin shines bronze under the warm sunlight. My entire body moves smooth and relaxed, every muscle stretched with elegance.I love these imaginations of running majestically in far off destinations. In reality though, I am a normal Chinese single child, having no connection with the wild aboriginals in my fantasy. Worse, I wasn’t even born athletic. I began running because of weight issues, and because I couldn’t play any other sports well. However, this most basic and simple activity unexpectedly became my greatest adventure.For a long period, running was a tough task for me. Each daily jog was a battle with the lazy girl inside me. Armed with an extremely stern expression, I would ignore her pleas for mercy as I marched gravely into the summer heat. Her resistance would become increasingly fierce as I reached the halfway point of my run, when my leg muscles would join the rebellion. However, after giving up and restarting several times, my desire to slim down was gradually replaced by an unwillingness to be beaten by myself.  As my own coach, I’d yell at myself, “Don’t stop! Keep going!” and I’d continue throwing my legs forward, cruelly but proudly.Over time, the runs became easier. 5 km. Then 10 km. Then 15 km. Even after my clothes shrunk two sizes and my original weight loss goal disappeared, I kept running. I would run in the summer though the fierce sunlight stabbing my skin, and run through the rain pouring down in summer typhoons. When winter came, I’d to wrestle with the biting wind that left my fingers as stiff and chilled as frozen worms. Soon, I’d graduated from that little, shy fatty into someone fit, confident, and strong-minded. The conversations with myself while running were no longer intense quarrels, but resembled chats between old companions, supporting each other through their toughest moments. The ache in my legs no longer made me feel panic and desperation. The heat burning my lungs didn’t result in thoughts of giving up. I learnt to stay with pain but not suffer, to not be afraid of being hurt. I gained the bravery to challenge my extremes and try to surpass them. As a single child, I’d always lived in my comfort zone, like a potted plant neatly shaven and well cared for, protected from bumps or bruises. I was groomed for a very predictable and safe future: graduate from a decent Chinese university, enter a respectable local company, then work in the same position until I retire. I would live happily and easily. Yet, there would be nothing other than dinners and weekends to look forward to everyday. Meanwhile, the wild woman in my heart would be slowly weakened and finally die when I was no longer touched by the poster of HWY163. Fortunately, I’ve begun to stretch out of the greenhouse and attempt to bear the storm, heat, and chill, because by running, I’ve learned that some joys and achievements can’t be felt without pain, risks, or challenges. They are all nutrients that feed the woman inside me. They give her the strength to passionately yell, “Go! Practice for a marathon and finish it strong. Go to another country and study the most challenging, interesting courses. Go travel through the Pan-American Highway like Ernesto Guevara. Go……” My heart beats fast for her words, yearning to experience all of those prodigious aches and joys.Honestly I’m still afraid of failures knocking me down and obstacles punching me in the face. However, I won’t be stopped or crushed by them, because deep in my soul there is a bold woman who can run to her destination through the pain, through the plains, through the hills, never stopping.",
    "Supps": "题目：Describe your academic interests and how you plan to pursue them at USC. Please feel free to address your first- and second-choice major selections (250 word limit).\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Media enchants me. It is a form of communication even more effective than language, perfectly conveying a producer’s intentions through sounds, images, and words. Yet, achieving this desired affect is challenging, a fact I learned first hand during my internship at the Shenzhen Media Group (SZMG). ;Shadowing my SZMG mentor, I’d spend my days rushing around the city recording the latest news events, then hurrying back into the office to edit the footage for broadcast. Observing the production process, I was impressed by the care taken with each frame angle and the wording of each manuscript. Yet, even at a professional studio, I saw how hard it is to perfectly express ideas through film. Formulaic editing sometimes made our broadcasts stiff and rigid, and ineffective use of limited resources often forced workers to sacrifice aesthetics and accuracy. While our successes made me happy, our failures made me even more determined to learn the necessary skills and knowledge to improve in my craft.I thus wish to study media through the Bryan Singer Division at USC so that I can continue to learn how to fully harness the potential of media. I want to explore its theoretical foundations and its historical significance. I want to witness how the real-world media industry works and how it uses media to communicate. At USC, with its prolific history in media studies and strong connection to the modern industry, I can get one step closer to producing pieces that truly represent my vision.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：The Cinematic Arts personal statement should be a carefully prepared explanation of the applicant’s goals, describing any film, television, scholarly, critical or other creative background, as well as career objectives. It should present a clear and accurate picture of the applicant, outline objectives in the field of cinema and media studies and explain how attending the School of Cinematic Arts will help reach these goals.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          The first fictional work to ever make me cry in the theatre was Cloud Atlas. I can’t say I even understood all of the metaphorical messages hidden in the film, but what I definitely knew was how real this movie was. The deepest sorrow, humblest hope, painful confusion, and helpless love between characters were so natural and lively on the screen, making me feel as if I were experiencing exactly what happened in the story. At that moment I realized for the first time that movies are not just entertainment, but rather an art with considerable impact and power.The impression this film left on me inspired my interest in film and media. Thus, when offered a chance to enter the school TV station in senior high, I took it without hesitation. For two years I worked tirelessly, turning myself from a layperson to the manager of the station. My main jobs were writing and producing, however, in order to be an adept manager I was also involved in nearly every aspect of our broadcasts. I still remember the hours spent staring at our lone SLR trying to create the illusion of multiple camera positions, or nights when my teammates and I brainstormed how to disguise the amateurism of our actors through scene design. Now as station manager, I supervise the work of six teams on different programs, and looking back, I can claim tens if not hundreds of standardized broadcasts and original videos as my productions. While they may not all be “professional quality”, they are accomplishments that I, as an amateur filmmaker, feel proud of. ;As I become more experienced in film, however, I have become more critical. Recently, I went back and reviewed some of my favorite movies—Forrest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption and of course, Cloud Atlas.  ;Now with my own media experience, I am able to recognize the montage used in narrative, the details in character development, the transitions between different episodes, and the framing of every shot. I think back to that moment in the theatre watching Cloud Atlas and can now appreciate the sophisticated execution that allowed the producers to project their intended thoughts and emotions without loss or alteration through the movies complicated, majestic composition. Looking at these masterpieces, then revisiting my own works, I feel unsatisfied. I’ve been able to create some romantic scenes or complete a story using my entry-level SLR and editing software, but they are still not living and breathing things; there is a separation between the thoughts and feelings I want to tell. Only when this gap is filled, with time, effort and experience, can my true intentions smoothly emerge as a complete work and appear vividly on the screen.These abilities are not easily mastered, but require creative instinct, specific knowledge, and decades of practice. Therefore, what I seek through the Bryan Singer Cinema & Media Studies program are not some ready-made procedures about how to make great movies, but the knowledge, resources and practice to gradually become a better film-maker. The program provides study in both commercial productions and artistic creations, and explores both advanced technology and classical approaches towards media and film. Also, through theory classes, I am eager to explore how human culture interacts with media and gain a deeper insight into how and what I want to create and the impact it can have. Most importantly, to make powerful work, I need not only theoretical knowledge of cinematic arts, but also substantial involvement in professional, industrial productions. From the “hands-on” projects to faculty with years of real industry experience, the Cinema &Media Studies program provides a practical environment for students to learn and create. ;At USC’s Bryan Singer Division, I believe I can become truly versed in media and begin telling my own great stories, finally presenting the same thrill I experienced watching Cloud Atlas in that dark theatre years ago.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：The writing sample should be a review or analysis of some aspect of film, television, or new media; a discussion or application of critical theory; or a published article.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          The qualification of Forrest Gump as a classic cinematic work has long been controversial. Despite its huge success at the 1995 Oscar and sterling reviews amongst spectators, journalistic critiques still show a subtle disdain towards it. It seems Forrest Gump finds itself in the same slightly embarrassing position as Liszt’s music: It is found everywhere, known by everyone, but is it a deep, enduring masterpiece? Opinions vary. ;Forrest Gump is basically the momentous events in 20th US History as seen through the eyes of a mentally handicapped man, whose characterization brings humor and encouraging factors to the film. Since the protagonist, Forrest Gump, is mainly a flat character reflecting traditional social values, this movie actually doesn’t aim at displaying internal conflicts and personal growths of the main character as most biographical films do. Instead it is closer to a historical account of American history through memories. Due to Forrest’s unassuming nature and socially conservative vantage point on historical events, the support and favor Forrest Gump wins seem more a result of the movie’s accordance to public tastes, not its actual artistic achievement. However its level of fame and worldwide influence definitely could not be achieved simply by responding to mainstream demands.The effect movies have on a spectator are dependent on their mechanisms of representation, including the transcription, camera and editing, and other methods to convert ideas on the pages into tangible medium. It is evident that the success of Forrest Gump isn’t a fluke, but results from impeccable execution. Specifically, the employment of flashbacks and voice over, the hooks and clues connecting the entire work, and the characterization have all become classical imagery in cinematic arts. From overall narrative to carefully designed details, Forrest Gump interprets and symbolizes traditional ideology but in a creative and unique way.Consider the movie’s structure. What classifies Forrest Gump from an epic film is the incorporation of personal experience and domestic history. Though the accounts of so many events risk turning into a bullet-point list, Robert Zemeckis skillfully avoids two possible downfalls: a blank biography without spiritual reflection or a lengthy chronicle lacking originality. Instead he gets the right balance between Forrest’s involvement in national events and the development of his relationship with Jenny. Thus, neither of the two main factors of this movie, the country and the individual, overpowers the other, but complement one another’s deficiencies. Forrest is elevated from a limited individual to a representative figure of America, while the playful, entertaining tone telling his personal life links the historical episodes without unnatural transition and  ;lack of emotions. This balance is exactly what make this movie acceptable while not going so far as to be overly frivolous. ;Another factor contributing to Forrest Gump’s success, which is even more remarkable, is the expressive details. One very artful and unique technique is the use of archive footage. Robert Zemeckis ’s insistence on never using actors to display historical figures required huge efforts on the part of the visual effect department, yet the effort ultimately produced Zemecki’s desire effect— a natural way to combine the experiences of Forrest and America. Even when displaying fictional plots set in the past, the director used the most concise scenes to restore the history. The group of frames describing the family history of Lieutenant Dan can serve as a good example: only a clip of each generation are shown, allowing for minimal historical inaccuracy, while all the elements such as the clothing and surroundings in those shots are exactly in accordance to history. Those small details are invaluable: the more careful the details and complete the representation of reality, the stronger ideological impact and empathetic response the movie will draw from the spectator.While vibrantly reflecting real history, the movie also has a strong central ideology through its winding plot. Forrest Gump has long been considered as a promotion of conservatism for its positive portrayal of loyalty, faith, family and other traditional values. But even beyond those elements, there are still apolitical depictions of the country spirit of the USA as well as the universal human nature. Forrest himself is a successful man grown from a weak, disable child, and can be regarded as a symbol of America, which developed from a dependent colony to an international power with military and economic success. The famous quote “ I am not a smart man, but I know love,” is a straightforward but still touching conclusion of the movie’s emphasis on positive human sentiments. Even the world-famous feather can be considered as a metaphor of life, though interpretations vary from the randomness of experience to the fate of individuals.Indeed there are probably no extremely abstract philosophical ideas in Forrest Gump, but undeniably it is a successful case of how mechanisms in movie production can drastically alter the ideological and empathetic impact on spectators."

    "CommonApp": "In second grade, I colored the ocean purple. Not in rebellion, but rather because I was too disinterested to discern the blues from the purples, the grays from the browns. My artistic efforts always disappointed my patient mother, who yearned to fill the house with cute drawings. But, even then my perspective on life was different. I was serious and focused; drawing felt like a waste of time. In my young mind, there was no future in art. Blink. Junior year and I am an exchange student in New York. Much to my dismay, the school required that I take a studio art course. Immediately, my mind jumped to the end of the semester; a giant “D” on my report card, my GPA a mangled wreck and the dream of attending a top college lost. In class, I tried, I really did. But, drawings of planes looked like ducks and please, do not get me started on my attempt at a self-portrait. My eyes resembled flying-saucers and my ear – a stalk of corn. (Yes, I used the singular. I forgot to include a second ear). Distressed, I went to the teacher and begged for my type of relief. I offered to take a test, on Van Gogh, on Impressionism, on Cubism on anything that involved me studying, memorizing and writing. “Test taking,” I assured the teacher with a broad smile on my face, “is my form of art.” My hope for a resolution to the problem dissolved when she grabbed my hand and pulled me into storage room where samples of student work were stored. Immediately, I felt a slow sense of exasperation making its way up to my throat. I looked around at the pieces, each so colorful and accomplished. “But these students are all in college studying art,” I protested. To my surprise, the teacher made it clear that nearly all of the pieces were created by students who were not art majors. Staring at their works, I understood that I needed to change my perspective. That night as I gazed at a blank white sheet of paper I realized that the class was requiring me to give up the safety net of notes and outlines; memorization and formula. I actually laughed out loud when I realized that the art class had nothing to do with art! I was the only one thinking that, in some way, I had to create a perfect painting to get a good grade. In fact, I was the only one in the class talking about grades at all! All the other students were joyously bringing their vision to life! My job, my only responsibility, was to think abstractly, create energetically and free my mind from the pressing concerns about grades, college applications, career and the giant storm of confusion that is the future. Armed with this realization, I threw myself into painting. Rather than ask about my grade I began asking about contrast, contour and – of course – perspective. Sadly, my planes still looked like ducks and I constantly forgot to include a second ear on my portraits; but these gaffs became topics of discussion. Was I making a comment on mankind’s ability to listen? Could planes be more environmentally friendly? I never created anything good enough to be preserved in the back storage room. But that is ok. My art was so bad – absurd even – that it generated great discussions –as teachers and classmates tried to makes sense of my world. I still think there is no future in art but I now understand that art is what makes the present so interesting. And, that is where I need to spend more time – living in the present, not worrying about the future but trying to master a new art: the art of living.",

In order to achieve this goal, I sought out the support of China’s professional media outlets. For the first time ever, students were empowered to report on activities from a student’s perspective. With hard work and dedication, Pharos reported on a variety of events, all deserving of people’s attention. Thanks to our efforts, students from all over China learned about new events and got up to date information on opportunities to help. ;"

    "CommonApp": "Sometimes when jogging on the school tracks, I suddenly imagine myself as a wild woman running barefooted on an unbounded plain. The breeze sweeps gently across my cheeks, and my dark skin shines bronze under the warm sunlight. My entire body moves smooth and relaxed, every muscle stretched with elegance.I love these imaginations of running majestically in far off destinations. In reality though, I am a normal Chinese single child, having no connection with the wild aboriginals in my fantasy. Worse, I wasn’t even born athletic. I began running because of weight issues, and because I couldn’t play any other sports well. However, this most basic and simple activity unexpectedly became my greatest adventure.For a long period, running was a tough task for me. Each daily jog was a battle with the lazy girl inside me. Armed with an extremely stern expression, I would ignore her pleas for mercy as I marched gravely into the summer heat. Her resistance would become increasingly fierce as I reached the halfway point of my run, when my leg muscles would join the rebellion. However, after giving up and restarting several times, my desire to slim down was gradually replaced by an unwillingness to be beaten by myself.  As my own coach, I’d yell at myself, “Don’t stop! Keep going!” and I’d continue throwing my legs forward, cruelly but proudly.Over time, the runs became easier. 5 km. Then 10 km. Then 15 km. Even after my clothes shrunk two sizes and my original weight loss goal disappeared, I kept running. I would run in the summer though the fierce sunlight stabbing my skin, and run through the rain pouring down in summer typhoons. When winter came, I’d to wrestle with the biting wind that left my fingers as stiff and chilled as frozen worms. Soon, I’d graduated from that little, shy fatty into someone fit, confident, and strong-minded. The conversations with myself while running were no longer intense quarrels, but resembled chats between old companions, supporting each other through their toughest moments. The ache in my legs no longer made me feel panic and desperation. The heat burning my lungs didn’t result in thoughts of giving up. I learnt to stay with pain but not suffer, to not be afraid of being hurt. I gained the bravery to challenge my extremes and try to surpass them. As a single child, I’d always lived in my comfort zone, like a potted plant neatly shaven and well cared for, protected from bumps or bruises. I was groomed for a very predictable and safe future: graduate from a decent Chinese university, enter a respectable local company, then work in the same position until I retire. I would live happily and easily. Yet, there would be nothing other than dinners and weekends to look forward to everyday. Meanwhile, the wild woman in my heart would be slowly weakened and finally die when I was no longer touched by the poster of HWY163. Fortunately, I’ve begun to stretch out of the greenhouse and attempt to bear the storm, heat, and chill, because by running, I’ve learned that some joys and achievements can’t be felt without pain, risks, or challenges. They are all nutrients that feed the woman inside me. They give her the strength to passionately yell, “Go! Practice for a marathon and finish it strong. Go to another country and study the most challenging, interesting courses. Go travel through the Pan-American Highway like Ernesto Guevara. Go……” My heart beats fast for her words, yearning to experience all of those prodigious aches and joys.Honestly I’m still afraid of failures knocking me down and obstacles punching me in the face. However, I won’t be stopped or crushed by them, because deep in my soul there is a bold woman who can run to her destination through the pain, through the plains, through the hills, never stopping.",

It helped me see that this is a place of boldness, that pioneers revolutionary studies and brings their impacts to the real world.Reading through Oberlin student blogs, I realize this spirit is actually born from the vibrant intellectual atmosphere and opportunities to put these intellectual ideas into practice. With few class requirements, Obies have the freedom to explore their academic interests in a place where vibrant discussions happen even outside of the classroom and constant questioning and reflection are daily habits. With the school motto “learning and labor”, Obies don’t just think, but also do amazing things, exerting tangible effects on the surrounding neighborhoods by establishing learning communities through unique programs like ExCO. With this kind of environment, I can understand why Oberlin has consistently presented revolutionary ideas to influence American society and the world.I’m someone who marvels at how physics dominates our world, who has endless questions about the causes of historical events, and who is enchanted by the rhythm of 1900s Chinese novels. I dream of challenge the unknowns, for both myself and society, and yearn to learn in a place like Oberlin, which involve so much passion, engagement, and hand-on opportunities. Here I would take the advantage of this intellectually lively environment, and boldly pursue my passion of human knowledge and my earnest desire to push its boundaries forward."

    "CommonApp": "“Please implement a feature to check whether students have actually seen their homework,” a teacher asked.This was the fifth time I had received a request to add a feature to our platform, which allows teachers to post assignments for students online. We had launched the beta version of our platform for both teachers and students, hoping to get their advice to quickly improve the platform. We initially invited about 10 teachers to our platform; however, due to our slow progress in changing the code, only three teachers remained. We wanted to make quick modifications to retain our teacher users, but as a computer science guy, I was instantly aware that making this change would require tracking users' scroll bars, which can be used to re-visualize exactly what’s happening on a user’s screen, almost equivalent to quietly installing malware to record our users’ screens when they are using our platform.“You know, the students are making up excuses for not doing homework,” the teacher said.My memory flashed back to an incident in middle school. In the middle of a math class, there was an unexpected ring of a mobile phone. The math teacher angrily demanded the student, we never knew who it was, admit his or her error. There was no response. Later, the homeroom teacher ordered some of my best friends to clandestinely search for the student's schoolbag in the suspected areas of the ringing phone. All of my friends thought that was bad, but they still obeyed the order because they were afraid of the teachers’ criticism. I don’t know if I had been chosen whether I would have challenged the teacher, but I think I would at least have chosen not to tell the teacher if I did find evidence of which phone was ringing. If I was not brave enough to blatantly reject the request, at least I could have resisted passively.“So that I can check whether they are lying,” the teacher explained.I hated the request. It was like asking me to install a telescreen from the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four into every student's computer. I didn't want to be the one who instilled fear into every student, including myself, that an \"inappropriate\" movement of the scroll bar could be used as evidence against him or her. I didn't want to have users self-censor their online behavior only to avoid being detected by my \"telescreen.\" I didn't want to be Big Brother, abusing the power granted him by the authorities. And, there was no passive workaround this time. It would have been impossible for me to always tell the teachers everyone had or had not seen the homework.I knew if I refused the request we risked losing one-third of our teacher users and the platform, I had spent three months coding, could soon become a ghost town. I could imagine being a “shrewd” businessman, implementing the requested feature, selling the idea to teachers that our platform could track anything they wanted, reminding them not to tell students about it. I could imagine how to write the code. I could see the function names, the actual code and the database structure flowing through my mind. I could build the \"telescreen\" in an hour. But instead, I imagined pressing Ctrl + A and DEL and erased all those imaginings from my mind, answering the teacher with a resolute \"no.",
    "Supps": "题目：Cornell Engineering celebrates innovative problem solving that helps people, communities … the world. Consider your ideas and aspirations and describe how a Cornell Engineering education would allow you to leverage technological problem-solving to improve the world we live in. (Please limit your response to 650 words.)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Years ago, I really knew nothing about artificial intelligence except its difficulty, but I speculated that trying to achieve AI would require a team of top experts from each academic subject working together to decode the human mind. In 2013, I happened to find a tech blog about a really simple algorithm for generating an abstract for an article. Surprisingly, no understanding of linguistics was required to understand the algorithm: Only mathematics, basic statistics and information theory were needed. That simple algorithm made AI less intimidating to me. ;That same summer, I had an argument with a classmate who is really good at psychological analysis. He claimed he knew what I thought by looking at my face, but that I couldn't figure out what he thought at all. I knew nothing about psychology, but I was unwilling to admit it. I threw out an unsubstantiated claim: “my computer can.”In retrospect, my childish claim was trash, but the idea is not. Those three-words, my computer can, have dominated my research direction in high school: using only computer science and math to solve problems that once only the human mind could solve. Finally in 2016, I had a small achievement. After many years reading famous papers on artificial intelligence, I solely used machine learning techniques to predict the evolution of future user interests on Quora.My research experience was like me against the world. I had almost no support from my family because they were either unfamiliar with the topic or thought it would distract me from school. When I asked classmates at school to work on the project collectively, their typical reply was “why don’t you learn some psychology instead?” I know I wouldn't have to face such problems at Cornell.In the Cornell Engineering information session, I recall the Director of Engineering Admissions reading the “values” of Cornell Engineering: “I love math and science! I love problem solving!” In countless college information sessions, I never heard anyone proudly say those words. For so many years, I was reluctant to say them myself, afraid of being tagged a nerd in the eyes of the future businessmen and businesswomen in my high school. Cornell students not only say these words, but live by them. ;When I read Cornell Engineering Spotlight on Students, I found Cornell Engineering student Mark Yatskar spent a year inventing new course scheduling software because what existed was unsatisfactory. He also participated in research of natural language processing, a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers “understand” the human world better. I believe I can comfortably work with such \"hardcore\" engineering students, who after suffering from the lack of solutions to problems share in the excitement of even small breakthroughs.It would also be great to do research on artificial intelligence with Professor Serge Belongie whose influential paper, Learning Localized Perceptual Similarity Metrics for Interactive Categorization, amazed me. The paper proposes an effective method for categorizing images which look quite similar to each other (differing significantly only in some local regions), but belong to the same big category. The method does not require experts to manually classify images to generate learning data, making it possible to get sufficient data from non-experts volunteers. The method solves almost all the theoretical problems of image classification. I’m inspired by the idea of the paper and wonder whether I can further my research with the similar approach to classification. Before reading that paper, I couldn't explicitly say why I wanted to study AI. Now I can: I want to break the limits of human intelligence by solving next-generation problems and in turn improve human's intelligence by the inspiration of artificial intelligence.My journey in artificial intelligence has only just begun and I hope my next steps in that journey are taken at Cornell."

    "CommonApp": "“Hello everyone, welcome to Computer Science. Before we start, let’s form groups of two. Every group should include a boy and a girl,” he explained. “Since few of you have knowledge in this subject and boys generally learn faster, I hope that boys can mentor girls.” I quickly found my partner and was eager to start, but a lingering feeling made me uncomfortable.Mr. Gao’s words led me to start observing the world around me more closely. At school, almost everyone assumes that “boys can do better than girls in science.” So whenever I received a high score on my physics test, I often received excessive amount of compliments as if I had accomplished an impossible mission. In addition, media and society in China like to make fun of female PhDs as if they couldn’t succeed in other areas in their life, so they had to settle on becoming intellectuals.After reading many articles on the Internet and books, I came to realize our society has used gender as a medium to carry out gender stereotypes unconsciously. Gender is no longer just an indication of sex. It is a set of unreasonable social standards that we blindly follow.It was then I realized how fortunate I had been growing up in an environment free of gender stereotypes. My parents always encouraged me to freely choose my interests and believed my abilities, whether it was in arts, sports, or studies.I love ballet, not because it is something that a girl is supposed to do, but because it has made me a stronger person. The bruise on my toes has endowed me the importance of fundamentals, and the bandages wrapped around my ankles to prevent repeating injuries always remind me the sweat and tear in practices. All the intensive trainings made each perfect split or a jeté off the ground more satisfying. Practicing ballet did not make me more “girly”, it made me more persistent and dedicated.On the other hand, I am a geek interested in computer science, which is against the mainstream thought. The tightly connected logics and extreme simplicity were fascinating to me. After spending a few hours with Java, I was able to create an app to help us memorize vocabularies better. Collaborating with my classmates, we improved the lunch ordering system with new functionalities within a social networking platform. Studying computer science has enabled me to think more critically and become more innovative. Utilizing lines of code in an artificial environment to solve real world problems, I am amazed by the potential of technology.These experiences have taught me that a person’s interests and potentials should not be restricted by gender. After all, we would not have an effective treatment for malaria if Dr. Tu Youyou chose not to pursue her passion in scientific research, a field that many consider more suitable for men. While I was lucky to explore my passions in a stereotype-free environment, I felt it was my responsibility to encourage those around me to pursue their interests despite the gender stereotypes. Whether it was encouraging a male classmate to continue his ballet dream despite pressure from his friends and family, or establishing an evening studying group for girls who are passionate about programming, I have tried, and will always try my best to challenge the gender stereotype so everyone around me can live up to their full potentials, regardless of their gender.",
    "Supps": "题目：Student self-governance, which encourages student investment and initiative, is a hallmark of the U.Va. culture. In her fourth year at U.Va., Laura Nelson was inspired to create Flash Seminars, one-time classes which facilitate high-energy discussion about thought-provoking topics outside of traditional coursework.

Today, even if females account for half of the workforce and have led some of the most preeminent companies, gender inequality is still an obvious issue.I want to host a Flash Seminar to discuss the true cause of unbalanced gender distribution in the STEM field because I disagree with the norm that since males are better at STEM than females, there are much more males than females in the field. Many capable women are discouraged to enter the field because they are thought to be inferior from the start. And because of this norm, women are less likely to receive the necessary assistance and resources to succeed in this field. This kind of environment is very unhealthy for females who are interested in STEM to grow and prosper.With the Flash seminar, I want to discuss with other U.Va. students about how to create a more encouraging environment for females to pursue and succeed in STEM field. I will also like to invite women who are very successful in their STEM field to share their experiences and offer advice to students who don’t want to be limited by this stereotype. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：College of Arts and Sciences - What work of art, music, science, mathematics, or literature has surprised, unsettled, or challenged you, and in what way? (250 words or half a page)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Shimoseka is a Japanese anime about government promoting ignorance to protect a dictatorship. The main character, Hyouka Fuwa, was a curious girl who was kicked out from the hospital because she asked too many questions about how babies were conceived. The story ended with Hyouka leading a revolution to overthrow the government in order to gain freedom to knowledge. ;The first time I watched Shimoseka, I laughed at the occasional comical scenes. However, as I rewatched it, I was able to understand it from a different angle. Watching the scene in which many sacrificed their lives to keep the revolution going, I was surprised by how far people were willing to go to be informed and to fight for the right to access knowledge. ;Owing to the invention of Internet, it seems that information and knowledge can be accessed anytime and anywhere nowadays. However, to some people and regions, the right to be informed is still considered a luxury. Hyouka was my inspiration to transform LIVE e-magazine into an informational platform for students to know and discuss issues in our school and society. While I might not be as brave as Hyouka to lead a revolution, I tried my best to bring the truth in front of our audience, whether it was about equal rights for homosexuality or a hidden construction project in school. After taking on the role of president of LIVE, I finally understood the importance of freedom to information shown in Shimoseka."

Although I didn’t quite understand the obscure psychoanalyses, the Freudian perspective that dream is caused by inner desire and is reflection of mind left me a deep impression. I found the theory fascinating because it not only explained why I sometimes dreamed of drawing or dancing, but it offered a bold and shrewd way to analyze people’s mind. It made sense to me.As I grew up, I started to read more about psychology and gradually tended to see the world through the lens of psychology. It helped me decode people’s behavioral patterns. For instance, once my club members deliberately procrastinated when they were going to fail their tasks. From learning about social psychology, I knew such behavior is called self-handicapping: people intentionally avoid applying efforts to keep potential failures from hurting self-esteem. As I was able to explain more and more social phenomena, I came to appreciate psychology – by interpreting people’s behaviors, emotions, and thoughts, it offered me a powerful tool to understand the human experience.Moreover, before I always felt upset about unfair social norms like gender inequality. But now, through analyzing the causes behind the social phenomena with psychology knowledge, I could apply psychology to solve social problems. For example, availability heuristic, a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to people, reinforces people’s biased thoughts in social stereotypes. Thus, by providing various perspectives on social issues like LGBT rights on LIVE and encouraging people to openly discuss, we partly restrained harmful stereotypical evaluations.In the future, to achieve my Magis in my life, I hope to ultimately become a psychologist to better analyze psychological processes in diverse social settings, and to devise more rigorous methodologies to find the best psychological solutions to address social problems."

    "CommonApp": "Growing up in a world where my parents are very open-minded and have never instilled gender stereotypical ideas in me, as a girl, I always thought gender inequality was an obsolete, past view of the ancient society. My parents always provided opportunities for me to explore my interests and inspired me to pursue what I truly wanted. I still remember they encouraged me to spend the whole weekends at the library to read; during school sports meetings, they would go to cheer for my games. Over the years, I have thus become an animation fan, a ballet dancer, an amateur painter, as well as an athlete.However, as I grew up, I realized the real world was very different from the world I came from. In my computer science class, Mr. Gao suggested each study group should include at least a boy because “For a difficult class like this, boys generally learn faster, so they can mentor girls.” He probably didn’t mean it but his words implied that girls couldn’t do as well as boys and thus needed help. “Am I really not as talented in computer science as boys?” I asked myself.Once during a shopping trip, I overheard a clerk saying, “My cousin’s daughter is getting her PhD soon but she hasn’t married yet. I will never let my daughter study for a PhD.” This conversation struck me. Isn’t PhD the symbol of intelligence? When has a girl getting a PhD become a bad thing? What if I want to pursue a PhD later?As those questions arose, I started to discover more about the real world I was entering. At school, almost everyone assumes that “boys can do better than girls in math,” despite that I am one of the best math students. “How does everyone know girls are not good at math if girls won’t even try?” Every time I went to the bookstore to look for books about photo and video editing software or programming, I was surprised by the fact that I was the only girl there, surrounded by boys. Even walking between the bookshelves, I felt uncomfortable. Every time I reached for a book about coding, I subconsciously began to worry that people around me would think of me as this weird girl who enjoys computer science. Many times, I hesitated and wondered, “Can I really be good at this?”Searching for answers over the Internet and reading many discussions, I came to understand the real world more clearly: While sex is given by nature, gender is defined by society. In many ways, our society has used gender as a medium to carry out stereotypes unconsciously. Gender is no longer just an indication of sex. It has imposed unreasonable social standards that we blindly follow.One night, I discussed my thoughts with my roommates. To my surprise, they thought that being seen as the weaker gender has a lot of advantages. They then listed various benefits of being a “female”, such as it is easier for a female to receive help and people usually expect less from girls. While I disagreed with them, I did not try to argue. I understand everyone needs help sometimes, but I just don’t want to be assumed that I need help because of my gender.That was when I realized how fortunate I was growing up in a “gender-less” world. I am a geek, as well as a fashion expert. I can “assemblé\" with “attitude” on a pair of ballet pointe shoes, and make a speech to run for the president of the Student Union.My world has influenced me to realize that no one should be given unequal treatment just because of gender, and from my various experiences in the real world afterwards, I have ultimately settled on my dream. I aspire to become a social equality activist in the future and my dream is to someday eventually eradicate the gender stereotypes and inequalities in the society.",

It was because of our articles about LGBT equal rights. Right after we published the articles, we were told that there was “inappropriate and disturbing content” in the magazine. LIVE was then suspended by our school officials indefinitely.Many of my classmates wondered why they did not receive the magazine on time before they learned about what had happened. In the past, as an editor, I was not aware that high school students were so eager to know about the sensitive issues in the society. Now, as president, I realized the changes we could bring to the campus. Despite the ban from our school, we determined to continue to operate LIVE through an online social media platform.Even if we need to sacrifice a lot of spare time and still face great pressure from some teachers sometimes, the amount of support we received from students and parents motivated us to keep publishing quality content and to encourage students to voice their opinions. As our popularity rose gradually, the school officials softened their tone. By creating such an open platform, we have created a more transparent school atmosphere for students.This experience is important to me because I have realized that freedom of speech is not just a natural right everyone should have, but also a luxury that we should persistently promote. I am proud of our LIVE community and will continue to make our campus a more liberal place to provoke thoughts and to advocate freedom of speech."

    "Supps": "题目：Beyond your impressive academic credentials and extracurricular accomplishments, what else makes you unique and colorful? We know nobody fits neatly into 500 words or less, but you can provide us with some suggestion of the type of person you are. Anything goes! Inspire us, impress us, or just make us laugh. Think of this optional opportunity as show and tell by proxy and with an attitude. \n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I’m always unsettled by titles like “female scientist,” or “female astronaut.” I don’t understand why the gender of an occupation has to be emphasized for females. Nonetheless, we never hear words like “male scientist,” or “male astronaut.” The last time I checked, neither English nor Chinese usage is gender specific. However, whenever we describe someone with a reputable profession, we often subconsciously assume they are male. It is ironic that an outstanding female professional has to be emphasized how rare she is.Strangely, when Tu Youyou won the Nobel Prize recently, I was yet again perplexed by the news headline “Congratulations to Tu Youyou as the first Chinese who wins the Nobel Prize in the field of science!” Where does the “female” go? In a field that is dominated by males, here is Professor Tu making a breakthrough in medical research as a female scientist. She is the living proof that females are just as good in STEM and could become an inspiration for girls who want to study STEM. However, the media purposely hide her gender from the public as if her gender were no longer important in this case.This is the paradox I am living with: on the one hand, I hope men and women should be treated equally. On the other hand, I hope the society not only recognizes but also emphasizes women’s achievements. As someone who wishes to eventually eliminate gender inequality, I also want to magnify this stereotype, so more are aware.For long, this has frustrated me. Should I refuse to use “female scientist” and fight against the masculine assumption in words like “scientist” and “astronaut?” Or should I use “female scientist” to emphasize the achievements accomplished by females in such fields? When will we achieve ultimate equality in the society?As I struggled to find an answer, I found a simple solution. According to Newton’s first law, if you want to change the motion of a subject, you have to apply a force first. When I started to learn ballet, I was asked to do “Relevé” as a warm-up every time before training. It was painful at first because our toes couldn’t withstand the weight of our entire body. However, this was just a basic practice that made our toes stronger so we could then perform all the complicated and delicate movements. By forcing myself to go through the “Relevé”, I was able to experience the joy of being a ballet dancer. Change, no matter big or small, is difficult. And the most difficult part is to get started.I have then realized the only way to solve my dilemma is to encourage and cultivate more and more female scientists, politicians, and business leaders, so no one will find it rare any more. Only when females in my generation are taking the initiates to break the stereotype, can we live in a perfectly gender-equal world. In the mean time, I will continue fighting and also appreciating the idea of “female scientist.”"

    "CommonApp": "“The witch poured some liquid into the princess’s mouth. She opened her eyes slowly and her pale face turned red.” “Mom, what is the liquid?” “A panacea, the strongest medicine, my boy.” “Does it exist?”“Only inside the fairy tale...Do not take it seriously. Have some sleep now.”  From that on, I started to entertain the dream of finding a panacea after having been hospitalized for two years due to thrombocytopenia. I cannot even remember when and how I learned about death, or the end, but I can still recall the nights I spent imagining the world without me. While lying on the bed, I often looked out of the window into the darkness and told myself “Perhaps I can invent a panacea”. Two years later, after exhausting all other options, I was miraculously cured by rhino horn powder. Since then, a white light appeared in the darkness.I became the most abnormal one among a group of ambitious kids who wants to change the world with wisdom and moxie. Whenever asked about ambitions, I was the one who sat most queitly at the corner of the stuffy classroom, waiting for others’ fingers being pointed at me, waiting for their laughters submerging my little dream.    Since panacea usually appeared as herbs in stories, I guess it might be hidden somewhere, maybe in the shrubs, or on a tree. I started to eat different types of plants I saw. “Min, take that out of your mouth!” my mom always shouted when she caught me stuffing flowers or leaves into my mouth. “Why do you want to study medicine, Min?” asked my dad. “I want to invent a panacea!”  “Childish! You are appearing as a boy who indulges in fairy tales” Tears started to roll down my cheeks. I was terrified. My fragile dream was being relentlessly stepped on, shattering into pieces. As I grew up and learned more about biochemistry, I came to realize how chimerical my dream was and found it increasingly difficult to persuade myself of the existence of such medicine. I underwent a dramatic psychological transition from a child to a teen, but still I could not resist thinking about a magical panacea and kept searching for any clue of its existence. It felt like stumbling in the darkness without a path to guide me, without a candle to enlighten the way, and even without a specific target to seek out. The only thing that existed in this void was a dim white light that appeared and vanished from time to time.    I began to read the latest news in medicine regularly. I learned about the groundbreaking progress in cancer treatment, how bio-medical engineering has made circulatory diseases more controllable, and how improvements in pill delivery can boost their efficiency in curing diseases like fever. However, whenever I looked up “panacea”, nothing ever came up because no adult would ever struggle with its existence. None. Gradually, I found myself aligning with those  “mature” people and started to search for papers written by graduate students of bio-medical engineering to learn what is “realistic”. “Min, have you decided your major?” Several months ago, my dad asked.“Bio-medical engineering, it pays well.” “It is good to have a dream when you are young.” “What dream? It is just a major” Feeling remorseful, I went back to my room. Browsing through the photos, in which I was covering my mouthful of plants with my hands, I asked myself, “Is the white light my ultimate destination anymore?” Or I am simply moving in the darkness, foolishly.  I looked at the white light in darkness, but I saw Armstrong stepping on the moon. I listened to a plane flying above, but I heard Wright Brothers being taunted. Let me make my own path, no matter where it leads to. Let me live in the fairy tale written by myself.",

After becoming attracted by the special school badge of Carnegie Mellon, which looks like a pineapple, I researched into the advantages of Carnegie Mellon over other colleges. Based on my research and close conversation with both my professor and other students at Carnegie Mellon, I have made up my mind to apply to Carnegie Institute of Technology and double major in biomedical engineering and chemical engineering. During my high school year, a large amount of time has been spent in conducting experiments in my school lab. In tenth grade, I participated in a chemistry lab club and we conducted a lot of interesting and simple experiments, including producing gold powder, blue crystal, small waterfall, bubbles of special shape, and making soda. I explored the knowledge behind these experiments and presented some of them to my classmates. These experiments largely established my early interest in lab chemistry. As I reached eleventh grade, I began to put efforts into more academic experiments that were related to medicine. As a high school student, many resources were unavailable to me and this was the first time that I felt my curiosity could not be satisfied at all. I encountered many problems, such as a lack of lab apparatus, chemicals, supervisor, and references, etc. All of these issues had to be solved by myself through saving money and looking for support from teachers and technicians outside of our school. Even a really simple experiment could take a month, and sometimes an entire day’s work could end up accomplishing nothing. Many people have asked me why I chose this path. Frankly, I have at least five versions of answers to questions as such, but it was not until recently that I realized that my stubbornness is probably what has been motivating me to look for reasons and persuade others and myself. It is a serious commitment to my childhood’s dream, which is to invent a panacea. ;After learning more about Carnegie Mellon’s engineering department, I realized that it is an opportunity that I cannot afford to lose. Carnegie Mellon has a really considerate and well-organized curriculum system that allows me to double major in chemical engineering and biomedical engineering without becoming overloaded. Also, I learned that undergraduates at Carnegie Mellon can have the opportunities to work with professors in research projects. This will not only solve all the problems I listed before, but also provide me with extra knowledge of what experts and doctors have been doing in this field. What I noticed in the introduction of biomedical engineering program is that there is one course called BME design, in which students with different majors in the Engineering department will be asked to do a project together. Having had similar experience before, I know how interesting and productive it is when people who are good at different subjects come together to do a project. Previously, I worked on an experiment related to low-density lipoprotein oxidation and collaborated with students who are good at physics to design a tract to simulate the blood vessel inside the human body. We did a demo in front of my schoolmates and the result was fantastic. One of the experiments that Professor Kathryn A. Whitehead at the Chemical Engineering Department is conducting is related to improving the efficiency of cancer markers through structurally altering the DNA molecule and letting them bind more strongly. Cancer treatment is an extremely important topic of medicine and I hope that I will have the opportunity to work with the professor to keep pace with the development of medicine industry.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：While not a requirement, have you been interviewed by an alumni or on campus representative prior to applying for admission? If so, indicate the name of your interviewer and tell us how it impacted your decision to apply.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          During this summer, I had a conversation with my chemistry professor Eric Henderson and PhD student, Gizelle Sherwood, about my future plan. I told them my about my childhood and talked about what I had done in order to move forward on this path. They asked me about what department at CMU and what other universities I am going to apply for and why I have made these choices. They were quite surprised at my decision to only apply for a short list of universities and my determination to set Carnegie Institute of Technology as my dream school. “ You do not have to be that focused while applying for a university because it would make you lose some opportunities.” “I heard that Carnegie Mellon is one of the most strict universities in the US and I am willing to take that challenge, since progress always stems from hard work. Also, the requirement for every student here to learn computer science also distinguishes Carnegie Mellon from other strong engineering schools.” This summer, I had a big picture of what students here at Carnegie Institute of Technology are doing and I found the rumor that life here is boring totally unwarranted. The robot snake shown by a student of the Engineering Department was amazing, and I could not believe how sophisticated it was when it crawled up the student’s arm. Last year when I studied at Berkeley for summer school, nothing of such kind was shown to me and it seemed that undergraduate life at Berkeley is going to be much more boring since I would not get the opportunity to spend much time in a lab when there are so many students. The PhD student Gizelle also made a brief introduction to the differences between the CIT and MCS and talked about the research and financial resources CIT has for students like me who want to have some research experience during undergraduate years. I think that CIT would offer more opportunities for students to collaborate since it is a really important skill that I have to improve on. Finally, Professor Whitehead and Gizelle asked me about my performances at school and my SAT/TOEFL scores. They both believed that CIT is a suitable school for me, which eventually eliminate my struggle between MCS and CIT to pick CIT as the department for my application."

    "CommonApp": "Growing up in China is very different from America. The most fundamental difference is that students in China are solely judged by academic achievement, so that it’s all about doing well on standardized tests. Both my brother and I went to the same school before I came to America. At the school, he was regarded as my shadow. “Why can’t you concentrate during class like your sister?” was probably the most popular comment my brother heard from teachers as he played with his Legos in class. It was easy to sympathize with my perception of him then, given how everyone else judged him. Even though I wasn’t the top student in my class, it was always reassuring to compare myself with him.One day, as my mom was driving me back from the airport for holiday break, we saw my brother cycling along the road on his fixed-gear bike, near the 50kph speed limit. I was astonished; I knew he loved sports but I never knew he was so...good at it.“Mom, his biking is too dangerous,” I said.“Well, there’s nothing I can do about that. I’ve given up after all these years. He can do whatever he wants to do,” she replied. There was nothing more to be said in the car, but I felt a strange sense of sadness combined with mischievous admiration.A few days later, my brother asked me to meet him at a cafe to chat. “What happened to your iPhone?” I asked. “It was much better than the one you have now.”“Well, I didn’t need its functions, and my school doesn’t let us bring phones anyways,” he answered.“So what happened to it?” I repeated.“I sold it. People are paying more than what they are worth nowadays. Plus, I needed the money to buy parts for my bike.”I knew my parents cut his allowance to discourage him from biking and distractions, so I continued, “Why do you waste your time instead of spending your time studying?”“You are just like the adults. You have no idea how much effort I put into biking.”I was beginning to feel indignant, but he wasn’t done. “Isn’t it the same for you though? You study math and science because mom and dad push you to. They also object your desire to study foreign languages in school. Aren’t you taking online language classes without them knowing? The only difference is that language is what you love and biking is what I love.”The little world inside me was silent for a moment.He is doing what he likes, but what about me? There was a time five years ago when I found my passion for French. But after two months of intensive courses, my parents didn’t consider them academic enough so the classes were cancelled. Eventually, I even gave up picking up words in my free time, or learning the language through film. There was simply no place for my unconventional passion. In America, I admired a Korean friend of mine who could speak five languages fluently. Often times, I wonder why that couldn’t be me, but now I understand it was because I didn’t have the bravery to step forward years ago. In front of my brother, I felt ashamed.After the exchange, I developed a new perspective of my brother, from someone good at nothing, to someone I secretly admired. He might be a failure to the world, but he has something he is really driven to pursue in spite of pressure from our parents and teachers. My entire perspective changed when I realized that what defines “success” is based on popular opinion that does not always celebrate a person’s individual interest. I now recognize that not knowing oneself is the biggest evil of all, and that it is important to value our natural passions before we end up drifting nowhere.",

Living in both Shenzhen and Hong Kong, the ripples of the fast pace and efficient city lifestyle had a huge impact on me. The convenience of travel, easy access to resources, constant exposure to the latest technology and trends, along with the go-getter’s mentality that everybody possessed helped shape my own productive habits and behavior. City life is where I feel the most comfortable.Another aspect of city life that I love so much is the diversity. Just like when I first came to America, exposing myself to the culture and different ideas pushed me outside of my comfort zone. My educational and cultural upbringing in China trained me to become a “soldier” that only knew how to follow directions and disregard my own opinions. Through interactions with my American friends and classmates, where everyone grew up in different environments, I found there are a lot of life lessons I have yet to learn. Most importantly I gained the desire to keep exploring the world to find the environment and lifestyle that fits me best. Diversity had played a big role in shaping my personal growth. This is why New York is the ideal environment for me; the city is vibrant, fast paced, trend setting, and filled with all sorts of people. Just by living in New York is already a unique learning experience, while the NYU campus will allow me to experience diversity without stepping outside of the campus.At NYU I want to study economics. My interest for this subject developed from being a frequent shopper who pays detail attention to prices and my own sporadic shopping behavior. Most importantly I want to study economics because of the aspect of human interactions and understanding social trends. I believe the well-rounded curriculum in the Department of Economics will provide me with a strong background in economic theory and help me become a more educated decision maker and consumer.Through NYU’s research centers and institutes such as the Center for Global Economy and Business, and C.V. Starr Center for Applied Economics I hope to gain academic enrichment outside of the classroom. I want to do research and delve deeper into issues that I often observe in life such as wealth distribution and the affects of social psychology on the economy.Within the economics club and finance society I hope to visit big companies and institutions around New York, listen to lectures from top executives of Fortune 500 companies, and build my network. Most importantly, there are substantial help in finding jobs or internship through the career development department. Furthermore, through the global career resources there are many learning opportunities through internships in different countries. Personally, my first choice would be Tokyo, Japan. Studying there will allow me to improve my intermediate level Japanese in addition to learning more about the culture and its relationship to their economy."

    "CommonApp": "Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an unforgettable place. There is an entire community that dedicates their life to chanting piously in the Jokhang Temple, and where kids my age already live as shepherds, tending their flock along the Mongolian steppe. Born and raised on that boundless prairie, one shepherd told me that the grassland was his whole world.At that time, I could not understand how they could tolerate the trivial and purposeless lifestyle. I was even shocked when several told me they were happy. Shouldn’t we all have a desire and responsibility to make our lives rich and full, like scientists who continually contribute improvements to human society? Surely scientists must feel happier than an office worker or farmer.In fact, with a deep interest in scientific reading, I was convinced that being a scientist would maximize meaning in my life. This was why I chose to spend two weeks at Qingdao University, working in a biochemistry program with many graduate students to further my scientific dreams. My mind immediately filled with images of great scientists: Albert Einstein, and Bhor. I imagined myself at the Fifth Solvay conference, as a respectable scientist debating the future of science.Things, however, did not start well. It was not until I arrived that I realized the university was based in outdated Chinese-styled buildings, which I had ignored the first time I passed by.The following week in the lab was no better. In two weeks time we failed experiments one after another because of tiny mistakes such as unnoticed residue reactants. Even when we succeeded, the result of our painstaking efforts was nothing significant, concluding with a set of data shown as an abstract chromatogram. During my first encounter with the control variate method, I also learned that the significant discoveries of Penicillin or DNA were results of mere persistence and luck.It was during the experience that I realized the life of science was just another kind of life, not any more amazing than ‘normal’ jobs like office work or shepherding. Too many scientists, I learned from the leading professor, would spend their life never discovering anything significant. That was when I felt greatly depressed, heavily discouraged in my pursuit of a meaningful life.Recalling the faces on the highlands, I wondered – who lived better lives? Whose life is more desirous? I realized that these questions can never be answered fairly. I may see huge possibilities from prestigious careers, but on the shepherds’ thin faces I could see serenity that could hardly be found in the city. It seemed to be a paradox, but the truth is that they simply enjoyed the life they chose.As my original expectations faded, I too felt enjoyment from my work. Time after time I was attracted by the images in transmission electron microscopy or the complex but beautiful structures of hydrogen hexachloroplatinate hexahyrate. The sense of fulfillment I felt was strong, even though life as a scientist no longer seemed as impressive.My experiences in Qingdao, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia showed me that all lives contain meaning and joy, which can be overlooked when using achievement as a standard. Such an understanding endowed me with a new viewpoint: As I again walk through the streets observing people, I see young woman leaving work trying hard to get on a packed bus. I also see an old worker carrying his family on a bike talking with his daughter. This time however, there is no judgment but only a respect for the lives they have chosen.Also, for a long time, my pursuit of achievement prevented me from exploring the lives around me, but as they become more colorful through my new attitude, I have a newfound curiosity for different ideas. Through my own involvement, I want to see and learn more from others, exploring the wealth of fulfillment people can find in their lives.",

With one can of each cola in my hands, sipping from both at the same time, the result of my research is the realization that there are limits to our tasting ability. For the toothpastes, well, it is probably not a good standard to judge them by their taste, but Colgate suits foam-lovers like me, who would like to spend time in bathroom foaming from our mouth. Some of these things seem to be frivolous, but to me they are the small fulfillment of my curiosities.When I firstly encountered relativity and its theories of light and time, I could not calm down from the excitement brought on by a totally new understanding of our universe. We all dream about traveling through time like the famous character Doraemon, hoping to see images of our past from our own eyes. However, it does happen, not in imagination, but in everyday life. Looking up into the night sky, the star you see is what it used to appear millions or billions of years ago. We can see the past! I poured all my thoughts to my friend, with great passion and anticipation for his shared excitement. Unfortunately, I still remember the confusion on his face during my outburst. It seemed they needed a reminder that they were no longer in a cryptic calculus or physics class.Eventually, my friends started to call me “little prince of science” (please don’t ask why) instead of my name, which brought much embarrassment in front of teachers or other classmates. I tried to avoid attention by acting more normal in class, but it was not an easy task at all. Many times in class I was so excited that I shouted out whenever my teacher mentioned familiar terms like “event horizon” or “Kerr black hole”. Every time I would quickly regret it because it soon becomes a good topic for my friends to joke about.No matter if it is curiosity in science and music, curiosity in taking unique photographs, or curiosity in the difference between Pepsi-cola and Coca-cola, curiosity is a part of my life that I cannot live without. It is like spark igniting my desire to learn from the world around me, so much that my life seems defined by my curiosity, filled with moments of enlightenment and embarrassment. It is curiosity that brings me colorful experiences, and that makes my life. Having courage to explore their own differences is the way colorful people live, and is also the way I want to live."

    "CommonApp": "It wouldn’t feel natural at home without the endless variations of, “Jeffrey, go finish your homework now!” Sometimes I would think it was my mum’s pet phrase, beginning from primary school; it seems procrastination starts early.Some days, I may close myself in my room and open “Records of the Three Kingdoms”, casting myself into the exciting battles or brilliant stratagem. Other days, it may be Behrman moving me with profound love in O. Henry’s “Last Leaf”. Meanwhile my composition (or whatever unlucky assignment) due the next day would sit neglected on my desk. I may tell myself banteringly, “Certainly, I will finish them later. There are just better things to do now!”I may simply be the “King of Procrastination”, but to me, “procrastination” should be redefined as “to be consumed by things I love.” I procrastinate not because tasks are too onerous, but because I cannot forsake the things I am enthusiastic for.During dinner, my focus is seldom on the dishes. When I was eight, after my first of many acupuncture treatments, I asked, “Dad, how can acupuncture cure my disease?” My dad, a public health physician, explained Chinese medical theories of pressure points and our body’s flow of energy. Other dinners began with, “Dad, why does blood coagulate when blood groups are different?” or even silly ones like, “Dad, will it be okay to insert ‘good’ genes into a sick body?” It seems often that before the soup is even touched, a discussion is raised from my curiosity, prolonging dinner with food barely eaten.I still remember the time I practiced “Schindler's List” on the violin during junior high. It was such beautiful music that I decided to practice until I was perfect, even though there was no performance to give. It seemed I was a little bit “out of line”, because instead of studying for a final exam, I practiced everyday during what was my “study time”.Was it a good decision to sacrifice studying? It is true that I did regret not doing excellent on that exam, but thinking back, the benefit of acing the exam would have been short-lived, compared with a mastered performance that will never be forgotten, and available at the lift of my bow. For that, each practice begets no regrets. For that, I procrastinate.I was also able to develop my unusual interest in history with my endless reading. It became recreational to share history topics with others while eating or waiting in lines, allowing me to befriend those who were curious about Ying Zheng’s feats, or the development of first modes of production in China.Similarly, the prolonged dinner conversations have influenced my life more than any lesson I have learned in school. The discussions started off childish, but thanks to my parent’s patience, I gained confidence to share my opinions and ask questions. I became analytical, and learned how to build assumptions and reason on my own. If I didn’t insist on having such talks at the dining table, I would have never formed my interest in biomedical science through my dad’s inspiring knowledge.I used to hesitate about my so-called dilatoriness because others disapprove it, but when I see myself today, I am more proud of what I accomplished in spite of my responsibilities, than of what I was required to do. This is just who I am, The King of Procrastination, and dictator of my own life.",

How have you personally disproved this generalization?

Walking into the acupuncture ward for the first time, I was shocked by the loud and heart-wrenching crying of dozens of kids with needles on their heads, arms, and legs, struggling awkwardly with tears covering their faces and saliva dripping from their distorted faces.Unfortunately, people who passed by the acupuncture ward commonly looked with revulsion on their faces. It can even be common to hear, “Cerebral palsy? Must be terrible to be brain damaged and retarded.” Outside of the ward, sometimes the two words were used to insult people. It seems with the disabled, we are not even tolerant or understanding.But it appeared I was “destined” to get along with these children during my three years of muscle spasm treatments. Most times, verbal communication was meaningless, but I still tried to talk with them during the long hours, sometimes even using hand gestures. I watched movies and TV shows with them, like the launch of Chang'e I on television, and went for walk together in the corridor (though they really walked slowly with unsteady steps). I was even able to see a six-year-old girl, Dongqing, return to normal life in society after 4 years of treatment. The experience affected me a lot, showing me that behind their disability or disease, they were the same as us.I think it was wonderful that I interacted with those “special children”, because they not only taught me more about cerebral palsy, but also showed me it is possible that we young people are quite similar, and can form close bonds with each other no matter our differences.

For me, this addiction bothered me from grade five to eight. It was common then to find me stuck in front of the computer screen, especially during holidays. I was lucky that it didn’t disadvantage me in my study, but I certainly could’ve done much better.More recently, I learned that Internet addiction is such an insidious problem that it can become a great problem to society. Out of curiosity, I conducted research last year—a big survey among 10 middle schools—to gather average time students spend on the Internet, and what they do. I then used statistical software to analyze the data and combined the conclusion with news articles to create a presentation for my classmates during a class meeting, to create more awareness for Internet addiction, and maybe through warning, help people overcome it.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：According to author Walker Percy, “At regular intervals, poetry students should find dogfish on their desks and biology students should find Shakespeare sonnets in their dissecting trays.” Explain why you agree or disagree.

It was always the case in primary school, after returning home, to quickly rush into my room, engrossing myself in history. I will never forget the “Records of the Three Kingdoms”, composed of over 900,000 characters that I read across two years. Meanwhile “General History of China” introduced me to the origins of Chinese civilization, beginning from remote antiquity.I love history because I can see the implications in daily life, learning how the food we eat and the traditions we uphold are influenced by certain events. Moreover, I found myself more social and interesting as I made friends through those curious about Ying Zheng’s feats, the colorful life of the Song Dynasty, or the development of first modes of production in China. Even as a biology lover, I can’t imagine how life would be without history.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \"If I know your sect, I anticipate your argument.\" Describe a time when your argument challenged a basic belief or viewpoint of your \"sect.\" (150 words or fewer)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I took part in a city wide competition of Rude Goldberg machine when I was in junior two, spending a month to plan and build a sophisticated contraption using simple and crude components (including Legos and planks) to lift a team flag. In the end, we earned second place.However, unlike most other competitors, I didn’t care for it. I could never understand the purpose behind accomplishing simple goals using over-complicated methods. In fact, I joined hoping to discover some profoundness to the objective, but left with even less enthusiasm.I follow a simple rule in life, and that is to remain simple. I think the beauty of progress lies in solving complicated problems with simple solutions, rather than the opposite. This is how I plan to approach biology in college, with a goal to finding more efficient solutions to the challenges in biomedical science. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：List five books (with authors) that piqued your curiosity.

Though his theories might have flaws, the are really novel and “predictive”, for example, believing that genes were a type of aperiodic crystal, and that mutation in biology can be explained by the Quantum Transition theory in physics.His analogies made unprecedented connection between biology and physics, which lead the field of biology to a brand new direction. Through him, I learnt that biology is not simply animal science, but was related to many different subjects and could be studied in different ways, inspiring me with the limitless potentials.Of course, it is also important that this book is not so serious, “relaxing” enough so we don’t need to sit beside the desk with pens and papers when discussing its brilliance. Last but not least, the many challenging hypotheses in the book can be an enjoyable challenge for me to “convert” my fellow roommates into the subject."

    "CommonApp": "Achoo!In kindergarten, I carried my handkerchief everywhere to cover my nose when I sneezed. It hung on the balcony, flapping in the night while I slept, which was the only time I could breathe freely without being interrupted.It may be ridiculous to imagine how sneezing can trouble one’s life that much, but because of my chronic rhinitis, since I could remember, every day was filled with crazy sneezing, while teachers and classmates talked from a distance. I couldn’t concentrate during classes because of intermittent sneezing and couldn’t act lively as other students because sneezing had tired me so much. By the end of each day, my nose was so sore that I wanted to cut it off.But all these physical discomforts were nothing compared to embarrassing myself before everyone, including those I liked and those who waited to see me make a spectacle of myself. I became so diffident that I could only bury my head in my desk and sniffle feebly all day.Eager to change the situation, I started with folk prescription. I stored a bottle of water in the freezer every night and poured it onto my face the next morning with enormous hope. Water always turned to ice and completely numbed my face, especially during the freezing winter. It was like the Ice Bucket Challenge except that I repeated the same challenge over and over again. I also tried another traditional idea – jogging. Dragging my legs and running alone in the dark, I felt my loneliness most keenly. Nights became longer and the weather got colder, but I still did not stop sneezing during the day.Over the years, I have used dozens of handkerchiefs and thousands of tissues. I have tried countless methods to cure my rhinitis, but gradually after endless failures, I discovered that the more I tried to avoid the disease, the more unsettled and alienated I felt. My behavior and reactions towards it created a new problem. I needed to face it, accept it, and embrace it. I could not change my condition, but I could change my attitude towards it.I slowly built confidence from the frustration I had accumulated. I was afraid that no one would like someone whose special talent is constant sneezing, but I began to focus on myself and live my life without caring what other people saw me. I began to break out of my introvert walls. Instead of avoiding strange looks, I actively began talking to people and formed many friendships. My parents actually went from worrying about me being too introverted, to now worrying that I’m too extroverted. Additionally, the purpose of exercise was to cure my rhinitis, but now hiking has developed into my favorite hobby. This is perhaps the meaning of living life with defect. Defects are not problems necessary for people to eliminate in pursuit of a normal life, but reasons for people like me to live differently. Sneezing spurred me to adjust to my environment differently, and while I may never experience a ‘normal’ life, I believe my own way of life is equally worth living.I am on the mend as I grow older, sneezing less as time goes by, but I always keep several packs of tissues with me wherever I go. They not only ease my mind, but also remind me of those old days that I fought as a helpless child, who I no longer am.",

In high school, forced by the education system to study 9 subjects simultaneously, I was frustrated when I had to spend time studying subjects I was uninterested in. Meanwhile, all my knowledge in history, such as the expansion of Christianity or the formation of England, had to be learned from museums and books. At Rochester, I hope to fully enjoy the flexibility of the open curriculum to gain comprehensive training in history and humanity courses.I am always obsessed with the Medieval Ages, the mysterious and fascinating period that connects the past with the prosperous modern Europe. While the majority holds an extremely negative view towards this, they have ignored the boom of religions and politics during that time. At Rochester, I hope to understand more about that period through courses like Medieval Europe or The Third World, and from rare resources at Robbins Library for medieval studies, to develop an all-round and objective viewpoint.Besides, through the opportunities offered by Public History Internship Program at Rochester, I hope to teach history to a broader audience by giving tours on Erie Canal boat or decoding ancient letters for museums, because I believe history can make people better critical thinkers.My whole heart is beating with yours, Rochester.

    "CommonApp": "When I was in middle school, my grandmother imparted the advice that “The greatest blessing of life is about not leaving a single regret, never having to feel the remorse of ‘ah, what if’”. So from that day, I began starting my journal entries with, “Is there anything that you would regret in these past 24 hours?”Sadly, I often stopped short of finishing the word “no”, forced to begrudgingly scribble “yes.”‘What if’ I’d ran another lap during practice? ‘What if’ I’d reviewed a little more before the quiz? I could have gotten a perfect score.I noticed that, no matter how hard I tried, within that limited 24 hours, there was always something sacrificed. With each opportunity taken (big or small), another was lost, leaving me wondering if I had made the right decision and regretting what might have been. Stuck in this cursed paradox of opportunity cost, I could feel the growing burden of “what if’s”. So eventually, I stopped writing down the question entirely. I had let my grandmother down. Maybe we are just two types of people, she being gifted and wise and I being… just the opposite. It was a long time until I started journaling again. Time away had given me time to reevaluate my definition of ‘regretlessness’. As I stared at my journal, a similar question appeared, but in a different form:“Are you satisfied with your decision to study aboard?” Dated Dec 25. 2012, the entry came as I was grappling with the biggest decision I had to make in life thus far: giving up my school career in China, leaving home for a radically unfamiliar life, and dealing with the grueling process of US high school applications. I thought about my grandmother’s words, and surprisingly, for the first time I wrote the answer that I long desired.“Yes, I’m satisfied.” Could my life be better if I had decided to stay in China instead of studying aboard? Maybe. There were definitely things being sacrificed: all of my friends, my family, potential opportunities in China and the comforts of living in a culture that I was familiar with. Yet in that moment there was one thing that I was 100% sure of: I was satisfied because I knew that the opportunity I was choosing would help me most to grow, allowing me to become a person who was independent, mature, and worldly.I still remember that, after making my decision, I sat on my bed and stared at the four maps hanging on my bedroom wall. The maps ranged from a city map to a map of the world. Since a young age, I had always wanted to see the world and break away from my current environment, a place that I found limiting and stifled. Here was my chance. Yes, choosing to study abroad meant foregoing other opportunities, but I found peace in that idea that only by choosing to study abroad could I really take the first steps down the path of realizing my goal to see what the world looks like and what opportunities exist in it.I felt I had finally found the key behind grandma’s smile. Living regretlessly isn’t about taking every opportunity put in front of me. It is about whole-heartedly pursuing the opportunities that will best help me achieve the personal growth that I desire. Study abroad was one such opportunity. Therefore, no looking back; no regrets.Since then, everyday, instead of journaling, I look into the mirror, think about who I am now and who I wish to become, and set small goals to achieve these changes.Everyday before bed, I return to the mirror and ask “have you accomplished your goals? Have you taken another step beyond your limits?” Through this active pursuit of self-fulfillment, more and more often I’m finding I can proudly tell myself: Mike, today, has no regrets.",

When asked why she participated, a smiling undergraduate immediately replied, “It helps me connect with the community.” ;In high school, my Saturday mornings consisted of waking up at 5:30am and feeding the homeless breakfast through a program called Clay Street Table. My weekday evenings were filled with planning school events in Student Council. Through this, I learned that school should be more than just classes: it is about interaction, exchange, and service. ;I see this same spirit of service and social action in Wake Forest. Advertising itself as “a place where serving humanity…is expressed in every endeavor,” I believe Wake Forest’s strong social sciences programs and demonstrated commitment to service make is a place where I can better both myself and my community. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe an academic or intellectual project, experience or pursuit of which you are particularly proud.

However, winning student council elections is not easy, especially for students living in the dormitory, which day students refer to as \"The Island\". Most “dormies” are international students, and amid the language barrier and dealing with cultural differences, there definitely existed a gap between us.Thus, for my student-council platform, I proposed a dorm/day student exchange program. The activity tasked dormies to stay in the home of a day student for a few days to promote dialogue and exchange. Parents and administrators were receptive, and through the success of this program, I won a coveted student council spot.After joining Stu-co, I have continued to coordinate more activities that encourage participation from both the island and the “mainland.” Through them, I believe we are slowly eliminating gaps and building a more unified community."

    "CommonApp": "I know a young man with naturally dark-blue hair and deep, indigo eyes. He travels all over the planet, learning customs from bizarre tribes and listening to fascinating stories from other experienced travelers. When he isn’t traveling, he lives with his cartoonist roommate. At night, the two take long walks together in picturesque parks, or have fine dinners at cheap restaurants. Meanwhile, the traveler tells his roommate the stories from his adventures, stories that teach his roommate that the world is so big that to not explore its beauty would be to leave life incomplete. I am there during their little chats, but only as an observer. You see, I do not live in their world. I started writing stories about my blue-haired companion and his fantastical adventures a few years ago. His fictional world has become a place where I go to escape reality for a while. It is a place that contains a certain magic that my life lacks. Now after nine chapters and nearly 160,000 words, my heroic traveler and his cartoonist roommate have grown to be more than just fiction. I see myself in the cartoonist: he’s shy but imaginative, diligent yet diffident. Meanwhile the traveler is a free spirit. He is responsible and loyal, curious and logical, brave and compassionate; he has all of the qualities that I look up to.While parts of my characters are definitely reflections of my world, perhaps the more important aspect of my story writing is how I have become a reflection of theirs. Whenever I have troubles in life, I often find myself thinking: what would the characters in my stories do? When I face big challenges, I think of my character’s strong belief in hope, and that makes me feel less desperate; when I make a mistake, I recall my character’s willingness to take responsibility for their mistakes, and it gives me courage to take responsibility for mine as well. Over time, this relationship with my characters has become a formula for my behavior; together with them I’ve been able to craft a moral blueprint, applying the lessons I have derived to my real-life actionsThrough this process, my blue-haired traveler and I have helped mold each other. For him, I’ve built a fictional world filled with opportunities to see mystical places and magical events. In return, he’s given me a chance to see life through a new lens and heighten my perceptiveness. Writing his story has taught me to look for the inspiring, respectable aspects of human nature out of a dull and sometimes harsh reality. He’s reminded me that ‘the world is so big that to not explore its beauty would be to leave life incomplete.’In my stories, certain characters have the ability to create magical wonders out of nothing. I like to think writing my stories has given me this ability as well, helping me recognize the once seemingly insignificant affections that I had been ignoring. It has made me appreciate those around me more, whether it be the friend who brought me breakfast on his way to school or my teachers who tirelessly work to ensure that I understand my coursework. In this way, I have learned that magic is simply that necessary spark needed when everyday life becomes such that I stop looking for its beauty and forget to cherish its good. These newfound senses of insight and gratitude have become my “magic”, brightening and enhancing my life.I am grateful to my blue-haired traveler. With every epic adventure, I am able to see his world from a different angle. With every story, his fiction makes my reality just a bit more magical.",

Please feel free to address your first- and second-choice major selections (250 word limit).\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Many of my relatives have asked me why I decided to study genetics at sixteen, comparatively early for my age. There are complex reasons, with the politely convincing ones being that genetics allows us to see into and even affect the future. At least my relatives buy that answer. Once in a while though, someone will pry for more. My answer to these curious inquirers is that nothing beats the thrill of exploring the codes of life and paving the path for new technologies that could potentially give human life a makeover. ;As nerdy as this reason may sound, my passion for genetics burns like a flame, and at USC, I am sure to encounter the “bonfire” that can fuel my passion even further.Going through USC’s website, I was amazed by the depth of biology major. The department is highly diversified, with a broad range of intriguing concentrations, like “Human Evolutionary Biology”, and electives, like “Origins and Evolution of Human Behavior”. This great variety of opportunities within the major is a treasure trove for a biology nerd like me. Given the complexity of any one particular biological problem, this diversity of courses is what I really need, as I am aware that any one biological problem involves many biological branches and that to master this subject requires an interdisciplinary network of knowledge. ;Ultimately, utilizing USC’s abundant resources, I will receive a comprehensive biology education, that will bring me one step closer to my dream of becoming a professional researcher.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：USC students are known to be involved. Briefly describe a non-academic pursuit (such as service to community or family, a club or sport, or work, etc.,) that best illustrates who you are, and why it is important to you. (250 word limit) \n                                  \n                                      \n                                          “You, and you, and you: You’ve got to give them hope.”These were Harvey Milk’s final words in the film “Milk.” Sitting in silence as the credits rolled, I did not know whether “they” had received this hope since the year Milk was assassinated. But at that moment, I had a sudden feeling that I would like to be one of the “you”s Milk was referring to. ;The movie “Milk” was my first formal introduction to the LGBT community. The inspiration that I felt watching it led to me to join HomoSociety, a school club dedicated to raising awareness for sexual minorities on our campus and in our community.Through HomoSociety, I became much more aware of the prejudice that sexual minorities face. I found this bigotry completely inconsistent with the moral values I’d grew up learning: that everyone is born equal, and that we should all show love and respect towards one another. Thus, I decided to make my small contribution to the fight for equality. Since joining HomoSociety, I have given presentations on the basic biology and politics of sexual orientation, written questionnaires to investigate students’ attitudes towards sexual minorities, and led trips to local LGBT activism organizations.Gradually, HomoSociety has become an important part of my life. Every meeting reminds me of the deeply rooted inequality in society and how much the world still needs to be changed. Big progress has been made in recent years, however, and I feel proud to be involved."

    "CommonApp": "“Don’t you know that it is very dangerous to play in that area?” my mom asked me.“I know! But that was what the director asked me to do!” I said. “And who contributed to my losing the competition.” I thought.In elementary school, I attended a TV show where many young kids gathered in competition. The TV show’s host wanted to evaluate how the kids would react to different situations with the highest total score after a week deciding the winner. I am the kind of person who always wants to win.One day during the competition, we were sent to a swimming pool with separated shallow and deep water areas. At first, all of the kids played in the shallow water. After a while, the director came to me and asked me to pretend to play in the deep water. I was a docile kid who would follow whatever my parents or teachers asked me to do because I believed they were always right. Without surprise, I agreed. In the following days, the director always asked me to “perform” and I did so. In the last day, I was shocked when I got my low score. I always did what I thought was right and I followed what the director asked me to do. There was no reason for me to get such a low score! Not until the day when my mother questioned me did I realize the reason: maybe I should not follow whatever authority told me to do.Why did I do that? I started my introspection. Because authority often gives deliberate opinions based on experience and are often tested to be useful. As a child, I am too callow to make circumspect decision so that I prefer to respect and adhere to elder’s opinions. However, the reason why I got hurt is because it does not mean that the ideas of authority must be the ones I choose to follow though I respect them. Their ideas are based on their own experience, their own advantage and depend on other very personal facts that are not the same for everyone, so they cannot work on everyone. I should refer and consider their thoughts and adjust them to face my condition and my personality to make the final decision. In conclusion, I should think critically when making decision rather than automatically follow the order of authority.Before my 11th grade year, I needed to decide whether to prepare for studying abroad in the USA or keep learning traditional Chinese education courses and go to a Chinese University. “My advice is for you to continue your study in China. You will have to improve your English significantly to achieve the American college standard but you can get into a good school easily with your current Chinese grades, which will give you a happier future.” my teacher told me. But is that really a happy future or a boring and predictable future for ME? I like challenging myself and to be conventional will just make life less colorful. Finally, I decided to enter the school’s AP course program. Now a year after my making the big decision, it is unbelievable and happy to find out that my vocabulary and reading speed has been improved greatly. Having more freedom to choose the class I like and do activities I want, I feel like I am living for myself instead of complete the process of being a traditional “successful” person.Critical thinking makes people different from each other, and this difference pushes society forward. My individual thoughts made realize my value as an intellectual person instead of an instrument. I am glad that I made the best choice that time to enter that AP course program and I would definitely make the same decision again.",

Though recondite for me to understand, I still feel the magic charm of science. In Grade 10, I was enrolled into physics competition class with the fourth highest score. Then in the learning process, I felt the beauty of conciseness that is presented by science. Finding the order and rule through apparently chaos is the magic of science. Solving a math problem after a long time and disputing the best way to solve a problem can just satisfy my sense of achievement. What is more, science can never be completed. There are always flaws in the former principles and can be corrected later. I enjoy the process of exploring and pondering.Considering my preference of science, I am fond of Physics most, knowing that it studies not only the nature rules, but to understand the behavior of matter and energy on every level, from the origins of the universe in the Big Bang to the interior of atoms in our computer screen. As a student who likes to take challenges and with strong high school physics background, I’m eager to take the Honors physics sequence, Physics 160/260, for gaining a thoroughly modern approach to both mechanics and electricity and magnetism. Moreover, I am desired to join the Undergraduate Opportunity Research Program, where I would create close partnerships with Michigan researchers and share a wealth of interesting research topics. What perks me up is the Women in Science and Engineering Program. I am excited to communicate with like-minded girls from diverse fields, such as science, technology, engineering and math. I enjoy the collision of inspiration. In WISE, being a wise lady!While a career in the physics is my current goal, I still enjoy other disciplines and want to explore new ones under the guidance of LSA. Communicating with alumna of my high school who had been enrolled in UM, I know that the atmosphere at UM is accepting anything I want to try, even outside my major. If I am able to be admitted, UM would definitely be a place where I could thrive both as a student and especially a scholar. ;Recently when I focus myself on UM news, I am thrilled to find that undergraduate researchers in UM discover new trans-neptunian objects. Being a physics enthusiast, I can’t wait to be a part of such a rigorous and vibrant community, seeking a pure understanding of how the world works and revolutionized our lives.

It was my first time to pave roads and build houses from every brick and stone. During the process, I enjoyed watching the new houses locating in front of us with our own efforts. I enjoyed hearing the salutation from smiling children who only knew “hello” in English. I want to involve myself in such activities in the future and appeal to more people for caring child survival and development in poverty-stricken area."

    "CommonApp": "On Becoming a Hero“Always remember that rescuing does not mean to sacrifice your life to save another’s. The simplest but most important principle is to save yourself before saving others. Never try to be a hero.” This was the first and the last thing my coach emphasized at each rescue course. However, I was too eager and excited to understand what it really meant because I was already fantasizing about being a hero. Months before the course, I told almost everyone that I would soon become a rescuer, just to enjoy their admiration. “Wow! So you are going to save someone from dying. Does that mean you are going to be a hero?” Saying nothing, I just smiled and walked away, imagining the day I would swoop someone out of water in a Spiderman-like fashion. “Yes, I will be a hero.” I thought.Training was punishing, but the fantasy of being a hero helped me get through it. Two days before the certificate test, coach took me out for one last practice. “Accident!” My fellow diver shouted when I was putting on my gears. Coming to the edge of the ship, I saw someone floating in the water, not moving. Already thought of myself as a rescuer, the only thing on my mind was to save him. So I jumped into the water and immediately I realized I had made a mistake: not wearing goggles. I gritted my teeth and could hardly open my eyes. Instead of keeping calm and run through a mental checklist, there was no logic or reasoning running through my head. I had only one single thought, “I am a rescuer, I must drag him onto the ship.”When I got to him, I found out it was my partner. However, coach was nowhere to be found, he must have already dove too deep to notice us. A paralyzing thought overwhelmed me,“Can I make it back to the boat alive?” I was shocked and froze for a few seconds before the water that rushed into my throat pulled me back to reality. “Thank god he is still breathing!” Coughing and spitting ceaselessly, I started dragging him back, while the waves punched my face constantly. Finally reaching the boat, I used my very last breath shouting: LIFESAVING RING! Being pulled back onto the boat was the last thing I could remember before I passed out from exhaustion.When I opened my eyes, three guys were staring at me on the beach. All of a sudden I realized what was going on, a “test”. Looking at them, I started to giggle, for my childishness and impulse: I was so naïve to think that my coach and another skillful diver would get into trouble so easily. “I was not far behind you in the water watching your performance. You did make a lot of silly mistakes but not too bad for a freshman. Congratulations, rescuer.” Coach smiled, and I could only smile back (But I really just wanted to say #$%! you).Lying on the boat, recalling everything that has just happened, it was so different from my imagination of my own heroic story. Trying to be a hero without mental preparation and absolute confidence in my abilities, I could have actually become the person I was trying to rescue. I used to believe that the most important qualities heroes must possess are bravery and the impulse to help those in need, which give rise to heroes in any given situation. However, being a hero requires much more than courage and instincts. A true hero is someone calm, wise and helps others on a constant basis. A true hero could not be fabricated. This experience was an important benchmark on my journey to becoming a hero and it probably will not be my last fiasco. It seems I still have a long way to go.",

My parents, who are both engineers made the mistake of showing me how to use tools at the young age of 6. I dismantled whatever I could get my hands on around the house. It wasn’t long until my tools were confiscated. My curiosity has guided me to the world of cars. This past summer I successfully begged my father to let me intern at his friend’s car repair shop, where I was able to get a head start in this field. In college, I want to study Mechanical Engineering, in order to gain the knowledge and skills I need to do innovative car designs. ;In USC, I will have the opportunity to receive an excellent education on machineries through the AME Department of the Viterbi School of Engineering. Class AME 453 will help me gain knowledge about propellants of automobiles and Class AME 231 will offer me the opportunity to learn about different properties of various materials. I will even have the chance to get in contact with the High-Performance Advanced Materials Research team to gain a deeper understanding of material selection when designing a machine. More importantly, with three design/build student projects, I will be able to get hands-on experience tinkering with all kinds of machinery and tools, while gaining experience collaborating with engineers of different backgrounds. I look forward to becoming the ace mechanic of the SAE Racing team and help bring home some championship trophies.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：USC prompt 4: Some people categorize engineers as geeks or nerds.

But my geek spirit can be trigger by various things.When my favorite game, Medieval Total War II no longer entertained me due to the “foolish” computer AI, I became determined to modify the AI myself. For several weeks, instead of playing basketball with my friends I sat in front of my computer programming to add new units and battle protocols. I spent many hours on forums asking for help and uploaded my custom AI for other players to test. ;Last year after watching a movie named “Shutter Island”, I was so outraged by the terrible and misleading subtitles that I joined an online fansub group myself to retranslate the movie. I eventually ended up translating many more.As a science fiction fanatic, the movie Alien vs. Predator compelled me to recreate the hidden pop-out blades that the Predator used. Without any clues from the movie, I had to use my imagination and designed it without any reference. Using springs as the “power source”, I designed the inner structure of the device to house the spring in a way that allowed me to utilize the spring’s maximum potential energy. After several experiments, a rough prototype elastic toy blade was born.Normally, I am just an outgoing sporty boy, but my geek cells could be evoked by random dissatisfaction and curiosity.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：How do you plan to use your engineering degree to benefit society?

The more painful work came when I was disassembling heavy parts from the chassis, enduring the smell of machine oil and tail gas. After finishing all the complicated work, I was always pleased to see a car functioning well again, but I could not help but wonder, did the repair work really have to be so complicated and involved so many heavy components. Why don’t we make things easier?After I earn my engineering degree, I would dedicate my career to designing simpler structures for automobiles, with lighter materials and cleaner energy sources. So when a car brakes down, the driver or mechanic does not have to worry too much about various shape of screws, different colors of wires or inhaling nasty fumes. By doing so I believe I can help make many people’s life easier."

I even visited the Hackescher Markt, where art works from all genres were hidden behind its mysterious gates. It was so much better in person than in a tourist book. Life was free and full of potential without the restraint of family. Within my host home things were less serene. Alice, the younger daughter of my host family, although 19-year-old, still had the mentality of a 14 year-old: irrational and impulsive, very un-German. Fights were common between her and Hans. Lea, on the other hand, always acted like the mediator and was able to find a way to calm Alice, and comfort Gabi and Hans. Lea is the fixer of the family.

Nadia from Portrait of a Spy, a controversial Arabic businesswoman turned MP-5 agent, who became indispensible in antiterrorism operations; Carrie Mathison from Homeland, who always manages to turn critical situations around with her innate ability to sense danger, and information analysis skills, amazes me. Seeing them saving the world with information and intelligence, I was fascinated by the power of information and the process of using vague clues to make speculations. ;I was drawn to cryptography games, spending hours deciphering words from random letter arrangements to look for the next clue. A single tiny mistake could potentially wipe away hours of efforts. “This must be what it feels like to be a special agent”, I thought. ;However, when I realized that the basic requirement to be recruited as a special agent in America is to be a U.S. Citizen, I knew my dreams would be gone with the wind. ;Last year, a project of creating a temperature sensing and regulating gene to insert into e.coli plasmid exposed me to the magic of biology. I found myself searching and analyzing information in a Wikipedia-like database of scientific obscurity, looking for the functions and backbones required by the recombinant DNAs. Eventually, a structure map of our plasmid, which can sense and regulate the temperature of green plants, was designed. I realized that biologist and special agents are similar in many ways: they have to be highly sensitive to information, they discover patterns, prove hypothesis, and create social impacts that can save millions of lives. ;This is why I am interested in biological research. Through making breakthroughs in research, I would have the ability to slowly change the world. In order to prevent a potential terrorism attack, a special agent in Homeland would analyze every single piece of evidence from over 30 year’s of a person’s information: from bank statement to utility bills to people he has interacted with. The tiniest piece of information can be the evidence that becomes the key of a life-saving mission. Similarly, biologists are able to prevent the next major outbreak of an epidemic by targeting a mutated gene from dead cattle. By analyzing the genetic and physical features of a certain species, biologists’ impact is beyond the lab. ;I might not be able to change the world as a special agent, but I can be among those researching telomerase to cure tumor and cancer or find a treatment for mucopolysaccharidosis, an inherited disorder with research in genetic mutation. In the hand of biology, I would have the power to make an impact, just like a special agent. ;"

Students are going to learn about the lab skills such as titration and buffers, gateway cloning, PCR and plasmid transformation. At the same time, they are going to do a research project on the functions of programmed cell death during the development of drosophila melanogaster. Through this drosophila melanogaster experiment, they are going to understand how the regulation of programmed cell death is related to cancer and tumor. Rigorous lab reports are required for each single daily experiment and a final paper will be due at the end of Phase I. The morning sessions will usually start with peer reviews and discussion. In addition, to prepare themselves with the background knowledge of drosophila melanogaster, this course will invite guest lecturers from the animal biology department. On the last day of Phase I, there will be an exam on things covered in the lectures of cellular biology and laboratory skills.Phase II is the rest of the second week and the first half of the third week. During this phase, further information about cellular biology would be given in the form of lectures every morning. Moreover, students are going to do research about the current available tumor and cancer therapies (available online or in the school library). Students are encouraged to talk with faculty from the department of physics if they are doing research on radiation therapies. Every afternoon will consist of presentations and discussions about therapies and treatments. This Phase aims at building up a general understanding of tumors, cancer and treatments, and thus preparing them for Phase III. An exam will be given to test their understanding of the lectures on the last day of this phase.For the last five days, Phase III, this course will take place off campus, in the Penrose Cancer Center (Rocky Mountain Cancer Center in Colorado Springs). Students are going to live-study the therapies that they have learnt about from the last phase and its affects on patients. Moreover, students are going to interview a staff from the cancer center to learn about genetic counseling, which are given people who want to learn about their risks of inherited cancers. At the end of this phase students will need to complete a paper about the programmed cell death application in tumor and cancer treatments, which summarizes everything they learned in this three and a half weeks.This course aims at guiding students into the field of tumor and cancer study, building up a panoramic view from the basic theories to the realistic therapies and treatments, the latest academic research, and the impacts that students can make in this field.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：How did you learn about Colorado College and why do you wish to attend?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          The word “mountain” has been so irresistible to me ever since the moment I opened the Pikes Peak Region tag on CC homepage. Always depicted as a place to start, to inspire, to reborn, mountain has been defined in this way for long and I never have any doubt; a college hugged by mountains has thus become what I long for. ;When I was reading through posts from CC students online, I found that one of the most frequently mentioned word is “liberal” (besides hippies). A liberal mountain college it is; hence, I foresee a 4-year-life with various opportunities on this campus. My passion towards biological research and bio lab has barely been able to keep me staying where I am supposed to be; Researches make up the life of a biologist. ;After spending my summer at a biology lab, I started to understand how focus and intensity win over the incremental efforts. I experienced the awkwardness of restarting my lab report after only a weekend, when 80% of my fresh memory about the experiment had been lost as Ebbinghaus curve suggested; yet I would never forget the great joy when I eventually gained the chromosome strand crawling on the glass rod after failing four times. Scientific achievements never come at ease; they are never done without a long-term focus and constant attempts.My preference to focus and intensity then draws me to the Block Plan of CC, a rare opportunity that allows me to dive into something that I am really passionate about (cancer research) for three and a half week without any interruption. At Colorado College, a school that is surrounded by mountains, liberal environment and lots of biological research opportunity, I would be on my way to start my career as a biologist."

However, my spine was shaped as a letter “S”, （with the angle of 45 degree in my chest, and 35 degree in my waist）. Sitting anxiously with my parents in the hospital, I heard the doctor’s advise of the operation treatment. As frightened as I was, I didn’t show my panic. , As I knew that my parents were hundreds more worried than I was. So I gave my parents a comforted eye look, telling them I can go through this.My beautiful hair that I cherished for years was cut off because of the need of the operation. The operation was big, I was unconscious until five hours later due to narcosis. Both sides of my spine were pinned by 8 steel nails, which were fixed by a support made of titanium alloy.The fourth week after my operation was my school orientation, I appeared in the orientation like a normal person. However, school life at that time was full of challenges and inconveniences.. Since my back could not overtake much weight, I had to drag a trolley case when everyone else were using backpacks; even though my classmates would look at me differently, I got no choice but had to wear a baseball hat everyday just like a boy, because my hair was still very short.My muscle in my waist always lost conscience during the last fifteen minutes of the class. And whenever my waist touched the chair, my wound was pressed and it hurt miserably. Thinking back what I had done so far, I refused to compromise. I told myself deeply in my heart: Yuting, don’t let all your efforts flow away. Be strong and show your optimismAs a science student, I have a heavy load of school work. However, I did not subjectively lowered my standard at any extent. No matter how late it was, finishing the homework on time and previewing the materials for the next day were included in my daily routine. Once in a math class, because of my unique and creative problem-solving ideas, I was picked up to the front to explain my method for the class. My back trembled every time I lifted my arm to write on the blackboard. Nevertheless, I still explained carefully with smile and confidence. After I finished, I heard a thunderous applause. At that time, I was so proud of myself that I believe I would overcome any hardship in the future. Throughout that whole semester, I never missed any class , and was the top 5% in my class.Because of my experience, I did some research on scoliosis. Scoliosis has a high rate (2 out of 100) among female teenagers. However, I found that most of the parents and children failed to recognize timely. Thinking that an early notice and diagnose is the key to treat this illness, I registered a public account on WeChat in order to share my own story with the public, reminding parents to check their children’s spines periodically. I also published numbers of articles regarding scoliosis, and these articles were re-posted [shared] for over 200 times. It is my pleasure to lessen others’ pain through my effort.Life is not always easy, but full of thrones and swaps. Thanks to the obstacle that I had surpassed, providing me the courage to face more difficulties with optimism in the future. I understand better to people with physical challenges, and I hope that I can spread the optimism and use my own effort to help more and more people.",
    "Supps": "题目：Describe two or three of your current intellectual interests and why they are exciting to you. Why will Cornell’s College of Arts and Sciences be the right environment in which to pursue your interests? (650 words limit)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          My first intellectual interest lies in Data Analysis and its Applications. By chance, I participated in a lecture called “Methods and Applications of Data Analysis” instructed by Professor Huiwen Wang, the Dean of Beihang University’s Complex Data Analysis and Research Center. I was amazed by the dramatic impacts of data analysis in helping government and business make decisions, such as providing advices in controlling SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). I was also attracted by data visualization, which showed how messy pieces of information form coherent pictures by star chart, bubble chart, polar area diagram, scattered plot, etc. This unforgettable experience did a great job persuading me that data can actually “speak up”.After that lecture, I kept in touch with Professor Huiwen Wang. Moved by my interest and passion, she gave me an opportunity to intern at her research project of Internet Big Data, and I was responsible for inputting all the correlated data into Excel. Over twenty days, every day for six hours, I successfully input all the data. The most exciting moment was when I clicked on the “graph” button, which presented various and clear pictures that contained meaningful interpretations. When I organized and analyzed data, I felt as if I was digging a magical diamond mine.I would like to study mathematics, especially the concentration on statistics because I have a strong interest in working with numerical data. Since being a Cornellian means to discover, preserve, and disseminate knowledge, I am certain that Cornell will help me realize my dream of becoming a data analysis scientist. Firstly, Cornel’s Department of Mathematics is formed with such knowledgeable professors, and the diverse courses. Professor Gennady Samorodnitsky, who is concentrating on Probability Theory, does researches that focus on Decadal Predictability of Extreme Events. If possible, I would like to join his research team and learn from him. Courses such as Mathematical Modeling will teach me how to implement mathematical models on the computer and how to describe the results of computational experiments. Writing in Mathematics enables me to “think as a mathematician”. I am also deeply attracted by the abundant events in Cornell, such as the seminar hosted every Wednesday by Department of Statistics, where there are speakers including researchers across fields speaking on current topics in Statistics and presenting new research directions. Seminars such as “Distributed Statistical Algotithms” by Gerard Biau, The Signal and the Noise by Nate silver are very attractive to me. I can get access to the most advanced researches and creative ideas. Furthermore, to gain a practical hands-on knowledge, I will treasure Cornell’s research opportunities to the fullest, such as Summer Project—Graphs, Chip-Firing Games, and Algebraic Geometry directed by Professor Farbod Shokrieh.Another of my intellectual interests is teaching. Since I was little, I always enjoyed imitating the way teachers taught little kids. In elementary school, I started showing interest in tutoring my cousin on a scratch paper. In high school, my favorite “activity” is presentation, especially explaining and articulating the problem solving process in class, which would make me feel like contributing what I learn to others in need. Thus, I would like to participate in career-oriented activities, including the Undergraduate Course Assistant, Undergraduate Tutor for the Mathematics Support Center, and further engage in various community services, such as Big Red Buddies and Encourage Young Engineers and Scientists (EYES) to promote more children to love science. I can imagine how content I will feel if I could become a teaching assistant or tutor, so that Ican not only share my understandings of mathematics to others, but also help students who have difficulties in learning mathematics or statistics.In a word, Cornell, with its beautiful campus, is a perfect environment for me to realize my dream in the near future.

    "CommonApp": "Despite growing up in a picture perfect family, the idea of “family” scared me. Parents’ overbearing love usually comes with obligations and expectations. Whenever I share my fantasy of becoming a journalist, a special agent or a scientific researcher, they would laugh and respond with “Marriage and grandchildren most important!”That is why I was extremely excited on my flight from Hong Kong to Frankfurt to start my yearlong exchange program in Germany, a place free of obligations and expectations. Everything went perfectly after arriving in Berlin. I was welcomed by the serene scene of the Spree curving outside my bedroom window. Gabi and Hans, my host parents, maintained a rational, systematic and well organized home: the perfect definition of a German family. We went on family hikes that took place everywhere in the city: along the Pankow River, in the Charlottenburg Garten, and even a one day tour dissecting West Berlin. I even visited the Hackescher Markt, where art works from all genres were hidden behind its mysterious gates. It was so much better in person than in a tourist book. Life was free and full of potential without the restraint of family. Within my host home things were less serene. Alice, the younger daughter of my host family, although 19-year-old, still had the mentality of a 14 year-old: irrational and impulsive, very un-German. Fights were common between her and Hans. Lea, on the other hand, always acted like the mediator and was able to find a way to calm Alice, and comfort Gabi and Hans. Lea is the fixer of the family. We talked a lot, from her job as a nurse to the differences between China and Germany. She was surprised when I told her that Chinese families are so tight that no secrets are permitted. One time, I asked Lea her opinion of Alice. “Alice is still searching for herself. She needs time and space. She is not psycho, just reckless. I have been through every big and small fight between them. I knew she would come around. I just want her to know I am here for her, no matter what.”What she said went against everything I believed about Germans. I always thought that the organized social system and straightforward personalities of German people would have a hard time tolerating someone as irrational and illogical as Alice. She might be everything that a German is not, but her family still accepted her for who she was and were patient enough to let her find herself. As much as I hate to admit, I was just like her. Sometimes I get stressed out by the trivial things; such as failing to write a basic program in JAVA or losing five straight matches in a table tennis competition. I get intolerant and temperamental; I become a brat. Fortunately, my parents, like Lea, were always patient enough, never scolding me and patiently waiting for me to come around. They support my hobbies that I have no talent for and they never criticize me for quitting. My family, something I thought was restricting me, has actually been nurturing my adventurous and ambitious personalities. I left Berlin with not only the wonderful experience of German culture and a fluent language, but also a better understanding of family. “Sweetie, you want to go out for a walk after dinner?” my father asked. Instead of responding with “not scheduled ahead of time enough” to avoid his disruption of my future plans, I answered “Sure, dad, coming right out.” Maybe I will never be able to change their expectations of me or I will always do something laughable to them. But I know, at the end, they will be there for me no matter how bad I fail or what I choose to do.",

    "CommonApp": "Once, I met a stranger in Shanghai, along an old road in The Bund. “Thank you for taking this photo of me,” he said. “Although this may be the only time we will ever meet in our lifetime, I hope you will remember my face, and I will remember yours, to appreciate the powers of fate.” It invoked a strange melancholy towards all the strangers in my life I’ll never see again. Another time in Lucerne, a street violinist casually mentioned, “Wouldn’t you agree it’s like heaven here, standing in the breeze and sunshine, enjoying your own music, while appreciating the lovely smiles of passersby?” Indeed it became the most memorable part of my trip.My world is a collection of these memories that connect me to those around. Underneath the plain exterior is so much that pass unnoticed. My dream is to uncover these stories and broaden the web that brings communities together.In my early childhood, I spent many days sitting under the dim yellow light with my grandpa, a math teacher with interests in many different subjects, who passed on many of his views towards learning and life. Exposed to various Chinese traditions, like calligraphy, literature, and even esoteric abacus arithmetic, I learnt to appreciate the beauty in diverse forms of expression. Through my grandpa’s narrative, Tao Yuanming and Li bai became my mentors, painting poems that uncovered deep-rooted emotions and conditions permeating society. Now grown up, I realize that grandpa instilled an important habit in me to pay close attention to, and appreciate the bountiful stories of the past and present. I craved for encounters with individuals like the old man and the violinist, for their stories and ideas.Then in high school, I discovered the school publication, Nirvana Weekly—a haven for me to pursue these stories. But what began with conducting interviews and investigations became written words that would convey what I learned into articles read by thousands.My first article was an interview with Mr. Wu, one of the million individuals who illegally entered British-ruled Hong Kong from Mainland China between the 1950s and 1980s. With a cup of tea in his hand, he talked about the starvation and political turmoil he faced in China that compelled him to swim across the freezing Shenzhen Bay. I also learned of the life that awaited him, filled with starvation, discrimination, and constant fear of being captured. Ultimately, he overcame the struggles, and after years of struggle, transformed into a respected engineer.“Longjing tea of the best quality.” He pointed at the leaves in his cup. “What I experienced is just like it—bitter at first but sweet afterwards.”Mr. Wu’s story taught me to cherish the life I had, but I wasn’t the only one affected. “I never considered life this way before,” a reader wrote. Many commenters later poured in similar sentiments, thanking me for uncovering such a profound story.That’s when I determined the importance of communicating ideas, to affect others the same way stories have affected me. I dream to show others the world they’ve overlooked, to discover the magnificent stories of ordinary street musicians and esoteric knowledge of distant countries. That is what motivated me to pursue journalism, a place where I can liberally explore the world and spread what I’ve seen. Then from these stories, I hope others may find inspiration and gain confidence to pursue their own goals, to form their own stories to leave behind some day.",
    "Supps": "题目：Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience that is important to you. What about this quality or accomplishment makes you proud and how does it relate to the person you are?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I think I am compulsive. I realized it when, the first time I found an unsolved Rubik’s cube on the shelf of a toy shop, I became overwhelmingly distressed by the disorderly patches of colors. They seemed pleading to be restored, so I spent two hours patiently tending it, until my persistence convinced my mom to buy it.Unfortunately, my compulsive spirit continued to plague me. The first time I watched The Matrix trilogy, I was confounded by countless themes. Names like Zion, Apoc, and Seraph contained Judeo-Christian references to the Book of Revelations; When Neo fights Morpheus in the training program, the recurring Yin-yang contrasts between the characters and environment seemed suggestive of Taoist ideals of harmony. Were Neo and Smith none other than Nietzsche and Schopenhauer under guise? What did the Wachowski brothers want to convey to us? Am I crazy? I don’t know, but it upset me that I didn’t have the answer. I would later own my copy, and ruminate the plot thoroughly. ;My ultimate accomplishment must be attributed to music rhythm games. During a certain period, this typical game captivated school campus as students religiously huddled around computers and laptops, outscoring one another with finger dexterity that can put expert pianists to shame. It requires propensity towards music rhythm, and instant reaction to match. With my love of playing instruments, it was addiction at first sight.Today, I can solve the Rubik’s cube in 1.5 minutes, and can also complete other variations like the 4x4 master’s cube. I have watched the Matrix series over ten times, exploring themes of fatalism and karma. In addition, I have won numerous competitions in rhythm games around the city, and according to a global online ranking system, I am ranked in the world’s top 150—an achievement I am quite proud of.In retrospect, I have to be grateful for my compulsive impulse, for it instilled the desire to pour practice in the things I love—things that require intricate attention to details and challenging analysis. These experiences have unintentionally given me confidence to persist and succeed in challenges I encounter, and an addiction for improvement.As I play a track for my friends, I unfortunately must have scared them.“How can you even follow those notes? You’re a robot!”“Actually,” I laughed, “I’m compulsive.”"

    "CommonApp": "In the past several years there is an impulse that influences my decisions, including my decision to study abroad. Yet I cannot figure out what it is. It bothers me so I decide to try a unique method from Steve Pavlina to address it.I close the window and curtains, preventing even a single beam of sunlight from entering. I turn off Bach’s organ concerto that has been playing on my sound box, along with my cell phone and computer. The room is drenched in complete darkness and silence, inducing a serene paradise for introspection.On a large piece of paper, I scrawl blindly, “WHAT DO I WANT IN LIFE?” I feel funny about what I am doing—thinking about such big matters in such big letters. My mood then is light-hearted.I am required to write down the first thing from my mind, repeating until I feel finished.I had pizza for lunch, my favorite food, so I wrote: “Have pizza every day.” It’s not hard at all. I smiled skeptically, but continued.“Play rhythm games all day.” “A room full of guitars—classical, electronic and folk guitars.” “Watch sci-fi movies like Matrix and Star Wars.”I realized I was substituting the original question with a less abstract, “What makes you happy?” It’s rather misleading; I want things that make me happy, but it’s more than pizza. I take a deep breath.I recall the euphoria from unraveling intricacies like algebra problems or Rubik’s cube, but particularly from books detailing the most profound obscurities of life. As the eyes traverse the lines, stalking the contemplations of the writer, the mind is provoked, challenged, and molded. From Amusing Ourselves to Death, I was appalled at the effortless sway of media on society’s subconscious, which instilled in me the duty of responsible journalism that I strive to impart in Nirvana Weekly. From The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I now know that the ultimate answer to the universe is 42.I once came across Schopenhauer’s claim that “one can do what he will, but in any given moment of life one can will only definite things.” In other words, our decisions are limited to possibilities we can conceive, in turn limited by what we know. I contemplated this idea, and wrote down: “I never want to stop broadening my range of cognition through learning and experience.”Well, what next?I recall a stranger I met in Shanghai, along an old road in The Bund. “Thank you for taking this photo of me. Although this may be the only time we will ever meet in our lifetime, I hope you will remember my face, and I will remember yours, to appreciate the powers of fate.” It invoked a strange melancholy towards all the strangers in my life I’ll never see again.Another time in Lucerne, a street violinist casually mentioned, “Wouldn’t you agree it’s like heaven here, standing in the breeze and sunshine, enjoying your own music, while appreciating the lovely smiles of passersby?” Indeed it was the most memorable moment of my trip.And once, while my roommate and I were brushing our teeth: “Did you know the Klein Bottle is a three-dimensional counterpart of the Möbius Strip? Except we’ll never see the Klein Bottle’s real four-dimensional form besides through abstract math formulas. Isn’t that a pity?”These moments leave lasting impressions on me, reminding me of the stories and ideas that are lost forever if I hesitate to seize them. So I wrote down: “I never want to stop connecting with others.”But that isn’t enough. I desire to spread this attitude to remind everyone to slow down for the fleeting stories and ideas present in everyday life. They may be simple beauty of life worth remembering, ideas worth spreading, or perhaps opportunities to make a difference. If everyone listened, the world will become a different place.",

    "CommonApp": "Once, I met a stranger in Shanghai, along an old road in The Bund. “Thank you for taking this photo of me,” he said. “Although this may be the only time we will ever meet in our lifetime, I hope you will remember my face, and I will remember yours, to appreciate the powers of fate.” It invoked a strange melancholy towards all the strangers in my life I’ll never see again. Another time in Lucerne, a street violinist casually mentioned, “Wouldn’t you agree it’s like heaven here, standing in the breeze and sunshine, enjoying your own music, while appreciating the lovely smiles of passersby?” Indeed it became the most memorable part of my trip.My world is a collection of these memories that connect me to those around. Underneath the plain exterior is so much that pass unnoticed. My dream is to uncover these stories and broaden the web that brings communities together.In my early childhood, I spent many days sitting under the dim yellow light with my grandpa, a math teacher with interests in many different subjects, who passed on many of his views towards learning and life. Exposed to various Chinese traditions, like calligraphy, literature, and even esoteric abacus arithmetic, I learnt to appreciate the beauty in diverse forms of expression. Through my grandpa’s narrative, Tao Yuanming and Li bai became my mentors, painting poems that uncovered deep-rooted emotions and conditions permeating society. Now grown up, I realize that grandpa instilled an important habit in me to pay close attention to, and appreciate the bountiful stories of the past and present. I craved for encounters with individuals like the old man and the violinist, for their stories and ideas.Then in high school, I discovered the school publication, Nirvana Weekly—a haven for me to pursue these stories. But what began with conducting interviews and investigations became written words that would convey what I learned into articles read by thousands.My first article was an interview with Mr. Wu, one of the million individuals who illegally entered British-ruled Hong Kong from Mainland China between the 1950s and 1980s. With a cup of tea in his hand, he talked about the starvation and political turmoil he faced in China that compelled him to swim across the freezing Shenzhen Bay. I also learned of the life that awaited him, filled with starvation, discrimination, and constant fear of being captured. Ultimately, he overcame the struggles, and after years of struggle, transformed into a respected engineer.“Longjing tea of the best quality.” He pointed at the leaves in his cup. “What I experienced is just like it—bitter at first but sweet afterwards.”Mr. Wu’s story taught me to cherish the life I had, but I wasn’t the only one affected. “I never considered life this way before,” a reader wrote. Many commenters later poured in similar sentiments, thanking me for uncovering such a profound story.That’s when I determined the importance of communicating ideas, to affect others the same way stories have affected me. I dream to show others the world they’ve overlooked, to discover the magnificent stories of ordinary street musicians and esoteric knowledge of distant countries. That is what motivated me to pursue journalism, a place where I can liberally explore the world and spread what I’ve seen. Then from these stories, I hope others may find inspiration and gain confidence to pursue their own goals, to form their own stories to leave behind some day.",

Yeats travelled along the coast of Ireland, his beloved motherland, collecting tales and folklore of fairies and ghosts from his Irish countrymen. The stories—compiled together with Yeats own verse—became the Celtic Twilight.Yeats’ narrative convinced me that fairy tales were not just for children. The native Irish spoke of fairies and mythical creatures as if they truly existed alongside them at home, “for in Ireland there is something of timid affection between men and spirits.” Sometimes fairies brought good fortune, and in return, food was prepared for these deities. Irish men and women gossiped of them like they were neighbors, even leaving doors open when people passed away, so spirits could enter and attend the departing soul. ;Yeats concluded with a profound, “Everything exists, everything is true, and the earth is only a little dust under our feet.” He questions what ‘existence’ is, to expand its inclusion of everything relevant to human expression, whether material or imagined.Yes, spirits, fairies, even heaven and hell, are forms of coping with unknown. As science continues to progress, these stories that once explained the mysteries of our universe are ceded to logic and rationality. However, that doesn’t even make them less valuable.When I was 8 I learned how the rainbow was merely the refraction of light, but it still remained magnificent to behold. I don’t believe in worshipping baseless ideologies. He only convinced me to respect them. While keeping rational, we still should leave space for fairy tales, retaining that appreciation for myths and fairy tales, respecting them for their cultural and historical importance to those in the past who depended on them, or simply for their beauty.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：We are a community with quirks, both in language (we’ll welcome you to Grounds, not campus) and in traditions.

    "Supps": "题目：Describe two or three of your current intellectual interests and why they are exciting to you. Why will Cornell's College of Arts and Sciences be the right environment in which to pursue your interests? (Please limit your response to 650 words.)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Information Science - Neil Postman once claimed that media is like a metaphor, not only shaping language but also shaping thought. I am an enthusiastic fan of social media, from Twitter to Facebook to Chinese Weibo—mediums for reading news, interacting with friends, and sharing our thoughts on anything from books to personal life. These new media platforms emerging from technological advance connected me to interesting people and ideas around the world. Shaped by these influences, Nirvana Weekly (our school journalism) has increased transparency across within our school, to motivate students to care more about their community and the society. These experiences have drawn me to the field of informational science, so I can better utilize the varying forms of media for pursuing more open communication.Mathematics - Why is math exciting? It’s the same reason why computer games are exciting—the empowering feeling of individual planning, the analysis using logic and insight, and taking full responsibility for win or defeat. Solving a complex algebra problem or figuring out the auxiliary lines to most efficiently prove a geometry theorem is a thrill unlike any other. It is also through mathematics that we develop our daily life and other sciences. Things as trivial as paying for your lunch or as glorious as determining the number of curled dimensions of space hidden in our universe, all point to the resounding importance of math.Lastly, I am immensely drawn to philosophy - When I first watched The Matrix series, the following dialogue confounded me, exposing me to hidden meanings behind commonality.“Don’t worry about the vase,” said the Oracle.“What vase?”(Neo starts looking around, accidentally breaking the vase beside him.)“The problem is, would you still have broken it if I hadn’t said anything?”After watching The Matrix countless times, I slowly realized how the crux of the entire series was hinged on this dialogue, filled with fatalism and various interpretations of “free will”. For the first time I was exposed to alternate views towards world and life. Matrix may be deeply profound, but life is even more complex and intricate, with far more equivocal choices and possibilities. From that startling point, I delved into Plato, Schopenhauer, and even Marx. From Schopenhauer I came to believe that we are bound by what we know. His theories inspired me to experience more, and to learn more in order to make better choices.This brings me to Cornell, with their perfect Informational Science department that few other schools possess. Through a systematical list of courses, I will be able to understand how deep technology has transformed humanity, and the way people communicate. I was also amazed by its interdisciplinary nature. Computer Science, Communications, Economics, Sociology, Applied Math, all require extensive thinking and analyzing, all providing me the thrill I seek, and the knowledge I desire. Among all the courses, Professor Tarleton Gillespie’s New Media and Society appeals to me the most. Indeed, “We are all immersed in a complex and pervasive media culture”, as written in the course synopsis. From the course, I believe I will gain deeper insight on the impact of new media on society, and will learn how to use my analytical skills to face the ever-changing landscape of media. Cornell is also a perfect place to separately pursue math and philosophy—my pursuits of happiness. Oliver Club, along with annual Kieval lectures delivered, and the Math Puzzle Sessions, together create an unconventional but attractive atmosphere for studying math non-professionally. Meanwhile, the philosophy department of Cornell provides interesting first-year writing seminar programs, which provides a great opportunity for me to partake in discussions. Also, the Norman Kretzmann Undergraduate Philosophy Lecture offers fresh opportunities to communicate with the greatest contemporary minds. This is Cornell, where a diverse array of resources awaits my varying interests, and a place I belong to."

    "CommonApp": "I was never a thin kid. When I was little, my relatives joked that I somehow “absorbed excess nutrients.” In the summertime, while my friends confidently wore vests and showed off their slim figures, I often sweated in heavy coats to cloak my shape. In class, with my peers raising their hands assuredly, I stayed quiet, convinced people would ignore what I had to say and simply judge me by how fat I looked.One last “friendly reminder” from my aunt finally pushed me over the edge. Feeling defeated, I stared at my bloated body and swollen fingers in the mirror. Tears streaming down my face, I was finally forced to admit to myself that my indiscriminate eating and non-active lifestyle were fueling my ballooning figure. Nothing occurred to me but the firm belief that it was time to confront my self-abased behaviors, build a better body and reconstruct my broken confidence.My weight loss journey was difficult. It started with harsh diets. As a long-time food-lover, my desire for delicious, familiar foods was nearly unbearable. Gone were the days when I could eat whatever I wanted, however I wanted. Only three days into my diet, I gave in, and ravenously ate plates full of my forbidden delicacies. Once I was full, however, I was haunted by guilt. I had betrayed myself once again. But I wasn’t ready to give up. Recruiting my friends for support, I started again. Together, we set workout goals and weight loss targets. Dividing themselves into two teams, my friends joined me for runs everyday after school. Dragging my feet along the track, I realized how truly heavy my body was, and how urgently I needed to change. Hearing the concerned encouragement, I continued struggling to put one chubby foot in front of the other.I could sense things getting easier. Soon, I had memorized the calorie counts for most common foods and could quickly calculate my daily intake. Logging my miles, I saw my daily runs creep up from a labored 0.5 miles per day to a confident, brisk 4 miles per day. My friend’s daily, positive words slowly began to block out the harmful taunts from my relatives that I had internalized for so many years. Meanwhile, the number on the scale slowly began to drop.Eventually I reached my target weight-loss of 45lbs. Looking in my closet, my loose-fitting clothes chronicle the weight that I lost and the inner strength that I gained. Taking control of my of my weight, I realized, for the first time, my own potential, resilience and limitlessness. Once, I was a girl who let others make me feel ugly and small. Now, when I stare at myself in the mirror, I recognize no matter what I was told, no matter what I thought I was capable of, I can always do more. With each lap run and pound lost, I reclaimed my confidence and recognized my own limitless and worth whatever I performed.",

During our meals, my grandmother would spin the dim sum turntable, positioning the freshest dishes in front of me, gently smiling while I wolfed down the food. Reflecting the warmth of each dish, those meals symbolize her earnest love for me. With each bite, I swallowed my grandma’s kindness and learned what it truly meant to care for others. ;Fried fish with my father taught me about perseverance.My dad and I often share fried fish together. His adoration for fried food comes, however, not only from the taste but also from the spirit behind it: only after high temperatures and scalding oil can the raw ingredients transform into delicious delicacies. ;When my father first started his own business, he encountered nothing but challenges. Yet after fearlessly beating through many grievous moments, he achieved success. Those flashes of anguish and suffering made him, just like the burning oil makes fried food, and he is now a passionate and tough man who fights vigorously for what he desires. Every time I have fried fish, I taste my father’s attitudes towards life through the burnt surface and become determined to pursue my dreams persistently, just as he did.Laohuo soup with my mother taught me about persistence.My mom’s traditional Chinese laohuo clear soup is like a delicious art form. When I asked my mother about her secret recipes, she told me the sole secret: patience and practice. She can spend hours preparing the soup’s materials and will carefully pour them into the boiling water, conforming to a prescribed order that took her over twenty years to perfect. Sipping the satisfying dish, I’ve come to admire my mom’s meticulous exactness and pursuit of perfection. ;Dim sum, fried fish and laohuo soup. These are the components that have largely shaped who I am today, and nurtured my dream to become a human rights lawyer. ;My grandmother’s kindness taught me to care for other people, and to share warmth with those in need. When I see discrimination against women, socioeconomic inequality, and various other social problems, I see a place where I can share this same warmth and love.My mother’s patience and practice have shown me how to successfully find solutions. Specifically, through her careful cooking methods, I learned the importance of taking time to carefully understand causes of problems and to never stop looking for solutions. Extended to human rights, listening and understanding the plights of the disenfranchised and marginalized people of society will help me best utilize my skills to serve them. ;Lastly, I am aware that this road to becoming a lawyer will be long and arduous, but with my father’s influence, I know I will be able to persevere regardless of whatever challenges I may face."

    "CommonApp": "In the past several years there is an impulse that influences my decisions, including my decision to study abroad. Yet I cannot figure out what it is. It bothers me so I decide to try a unique method from Steve Pavlina to address it.I close the window and curtains, preventing even a single beam of sunlight from entering. I turn off Bach’s organ concerto that has been playing on my sound box, along with my cell phone and computer. The room is drenched in complete darkness and silence, inducing a serene paradise for introspection.On a large piece of paper, I scrawl blindly, “WHAT DO I WANT IN LIFE?” I feel funny about what I am doing—thinking about such big matters in such big letters. My mood then is light-hearted.I am required to write down the first thing from my mind, repeating until I feel finished.I had pizza for lunch, my favorite food, so I wrote: “Have pizza every day.” It’s not hard at all. I smiled skeptically, but continued.“Play rhythm games all day.” “A room full of guitars—classical, electronic and folk guitars.” “Watch sci-fi movies like Matrix and Star Wars.”I realized I was substituting the original question with a less abstract, “What makes you happy?” It’s rather misleading; I want things that make me happy, but it’s more than pizza. I take a deep breath.I recall the euphoria from unraveling intricacies like algebra problems or Rubik’s cube, but particularly from books detailing the most profound obscurities of life. As the eyes traverse the lines, stalking the contemplations of the writer, the mind is provoked, challenged, and molded. From Amusing Ourselves to Death, I was appalled at the effortless sway of media on society’s subconscious, which instilled in me the duty of responsible journalism that I strive to impart in Nirvana Weekly. From The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I now know that the ultimate answer to the universe is 42.I once came across Schopenhauer’s claim that “one can do what he will, but in any given moment of life one can will only definite things.” In other words, our decisions are limited to possibilities we can conceive, in turn limited by what we know. I contemplated this idea, and wrote down: “I never want to stop broadening my range of cognition through learning and experience.”Well, what next?I recall a stranger I met in Shanghai, along an old road in The Bund. “Thank you for taking this photo of me. Although this may be the only time we will ever meet in our lifetime, I hope you will remember my face, and I will remember yours, to appreciate the powers of fate.” It invoked a strange melancholy towards all the strangers in my life I’ll never see again.Another time in Lucerne, a street violinist casually mentioned, “Wouldn’t you agree it’s like heaven here, standing in the breeze and sunshine, enjoying your own music, while appreciating the lovely smiles of passersby?” Indeed it was the most memorable moment of my trip.And once, while my roommate and I were brushing our teeth: “Did you know the Klein Bottle is a three-dimensional counterpart of the Möbius Strip? Except we’ll never see the Klein Bottle’s real four-dimensional form besides through abstract math formulas. Isn’t that a pity?”These moments leave lasting impressions on me, reminding me of the stories and ideas that are lost forever if I hesitate to seize them. So I wrote down: “I never want to stop connecting with others.”But that isn’t enough. I desire to spread this attitude to remind everyone to slow down for the fleeting stories and ideas present in everyday life. They may be simple beauty of life worth remembering, ideas worth spreading, or perhaps opportunities to make a difference. If everyone listened, the world will become a different place.",

I was exposed to alternate, but equally acceptable views in life, attracting me to the subject of philosophy, or more broadly, humanities.Humanities is what distinguishes humans from animals: while social and natural sciences are the study of external observations for empirical answers, humanities is the introspection of human life and all that enriches how we outwardly connect with others.

It is from a familiar user, so I click into it only to discover an empty post. Skimming across the meaningless comments from other users, I smile before clicking the red X on the upright corner. Must be the academic stress of the season.We have connected several times by now, once to clarify the “monotonicity” of derivative functions, and another to debate whether it was unawareness or intentional disregard of school policy by teachers disallowing mobile phones in class. Each time, he managed to convince me with his insightful reasoning. From our conversations, I deem him an interesting person, amongst those few we encounter in life. However, beyond the whimsical discussions, we never interacted further.A month later, I clicked into the same post again, finding an outpour of comments like “Saddened” and “He was so young. Why?”A sense of foreboding spilled from my gut; the day before, a senior student had jumped from a building and died. I did not dwell on it too much when I first heard the news, because after all, suicides are the leading cause of death amongst high school students in China, common knowledge to us. We’ve learned to tune out those news before they can distract us from the important examinations. That was before I found out it was him.Scrolling down the page rereading our shared discussions, a sense of hollowness emerged, knowing that his voice no longer existed.“Your idea reminds me of ‘Brain in a vat’, an interesting thought experiment. Yet following the principle of Occam's razor, I choose not to believe in it.”“I also can’t wait to watch the new season of Big Bang!”“Cheers for Lakers!”On his profile page, I found this surreptitious greeting: “Welcome! I wish you happiness everyday.”I wonder what he was thinking when he typed those words. Perhaps the word ‘happiness’ for him was just polite greeting. But I really yearn go back and wake him up, to tell him it’s more than that. Happiness is the feeling of waking up in the morning to see breakfast made by mum. Happiness is pushing boundaries of life to finally achieve great goals. Happiness is noticing the beauty that passes by in daily life.  ;Happiness is everywhere in daily life. Why couldn’t he see that?“My life is like a play, which at the moment lack funds, performers, and script.”The support from your family and friends are the biggest funds; you yourself are the most extraordinary performer; And script? The best script in the world was there all along—your experiences overcoming challenges, finding love, and building accomplishments are what define your film. Everyone has an awesome script. It’s only that sometimes we need someone to remind us of it, and that’s what I’m here for."

    "CommonApp": "My oil painting teacher, Mrs. Wu Xiaoyan, once told our class that, before committing oneself to painting, the most significant task was to notice the elusive temperatures of the light and gentle shadows in the scenery. She instructed us to be meticulous in our preparation -- paying close attention to hue, properly mixing diverse colors, squinting at the color charts to ensure chromatic accuracy– as this was the most important step to creating a successful painting. At the time, I did not appreciate this instruction. Precocious and overeager, I believed that paying so much attention to something so subtle was unnecessarily time-consuming and demanding. As a result, the atmosphere of my earliest paintings fell flat. When compared with the original scenery, my paintings were glutted with distorted objects, excessive light shadow, and unsightly, rough lumps of color. Though I had thrown my full enthusiasm and vigor into my paintings, they fell far short of my artistic goal.Disappointed, I decided to revisit Mrs. Wu’s instructions and began to take the time to observe the nature that I was trying to capture. Wielding this new approach, my art flourished. With Mrs. Wu at the helm, our art class became an open forum for me to express my ideas. Together with my classmates, we were like the singers in Barratier’s Les Choristes, except, instead of a piano, we had canvas. Paying attention to each brushstroke, our paintings became painstaking efforts to convey our own creativity and internal values through the most perfect medium that we knew how. Through this class, Mrs. Wu showed me that meaning exists in details. Before, I generally focused on main colors, textures, and subjects. Now, I am apt to perceive technique: how to use brushstrokes to depict landscapes, people, and objects; how to choose the most desirable angle to portray subjects. As a result, my artwork has become more vivid and accurate to my vision.These lessons in nuance, however, have extended far beyond painting. They have led me to perceive the world from different, more complex angles. Before, when I traveled to a new place, I would just “enjoy” impressive sceneries: I appreciated the beautiful night view of Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbor and applauded the superb architecture of Shanghai Oriental Pearl Tower. Gradually though, with the help of painting, I learned to dig deeper. I researched the origins of Victoria Harbor and examined the intricate beaming of the Tower. These abilities found their way into my study habits as well. In the past, my teachers would have us recite passages from textbooks, such as the exact dates of the French Revolution or the watershed of World War II. After painting, I began to explore these key points beyond class. I talked about them with my classmates or found relevant books in the library or online. I began to see how much information existed below my previous surface-level analysis.Maybe most importantly, this newfound perceptiveness has helped me find nuances within myself: my merits, my faults, things that need to be improve, things that need to be perfected. Before – just like with my art – I was complacent. Subtle questions such as how to best communicate with others, how to control my temper, or how to balance my academic study and extracurricular activities were glossed over. I didn’t think these subtleties mattered. Yet as painting became a larger part of my life, I gradually began to view my life in the same way that I viewed my paintings: with a careful, critical eye. I looked to discover my merits and nurture them, find my faults and vices and eradicate them. Through a focus on details, I learned how create a more perfect, well-rounded version of myself.The Irish poet Oscar Wilde famously said that “life imitates art.” From my experience, I must agree. Although I have made my paintings, my paintings have arguably done more to make me.",
    "Supps": "题目：USC students are known to be involved. Briefly describe a non-academic pursuit (such as service to community or family, a club or sport, or work, etc.,) that best illustrates who you are, and why it is important to you. (250 word limit)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I have always had an interest in environmental conservation and sustainability. Thus, to explore this interest from an industrial angle, I worked as a sewage treatment assistant in the Red Apple Furniture Company factory in the summers following the 10th and 11th grade.Attending the internship was my first real-world experience related to sustainability and waste-water management. During my time at the company, I had various hands-on opportunities relating to water purification, such as operating wastewater sludge pumps, reading and interpreting data from the liquid level meter, and ensuring the quality of processed water. I also learned about the science behind sewage treatment, including precipitation of solid wastes, separation and filtration techniques, and even anaerobic-aerobic activated sludge neutralization.Beyond industrial knowledge, this internship also played a significant role in shaping my future goals. Seeing the complicated water purification process first-hand showed me just how incredibly toxic untreated wastewater is. I was thus shocked and dismayed to learn that currently, there are still many factories that dump untreated wastes into rivers, where these chemicals can enter into irrigation and water supplies. After my internship, this irresponsible action is unacceptable to me.Growing up near Dongguan, a heavily polluted industrial area in southern China, I already had a strong desire to utilize chemistry to attack environmental problems. My sewage treatment internship strengthened this previous interest in environmental chemistry and made me more determined to combat currently inadequate wastewater management policies and environmental remediation projects.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe your academic interests and how you plan to pursue them at USC.

There, I saw rivers that had turned sickly shades of green and red due to heavy metal pollution. Nearby, trees had few leaves and grew deformed fruits.  ;Seeing such appalling pollution mere hours away from my home, I realized the severity of environmental chemistry-related problems and felt a new urgency to address them.With these interests in chemistry and environmental conservation, I can think of no better place than USC to spend my next four years.Of its many offerings, USC’s “Freshman Science Honors Program (FSH)” is a particularly attractive option to explore my chemistry interests. Here, with individualized attention from faculty, I can build a strong foundation in the natural sciences, cultivate my multidisciplinary research abilities, learn the basics of experimental design, and frequently share my ideas with other enthusiastic, likeminded USC Trojans. ;In relation to sustainability, USC is an ideal place for study due to the “Center for Sustainable Cities”, which aims to tackle metropolitan sustainability challenges. Through the center, I could become involved in projects that work to create innovative solutions to current pollution problems. I believe these sorts of projects would be a perfect capstone to my USC experience, linking my environmental interests with hands-on research experiences and real-life environmental field study.In the future, I wish to become a scholastic and skillful chemist, faithful to my community, who will courageously and ambitiously tackle environmental problems. USC’s plentiful resources can help me achieve this goal."

From a mini-racing car, a night-light in a chocolate box, to a spring driven wheel, we built many silly things together. These little practices accustomed me to structural analysis and abstract thinking, as well as gaining hands-on skills.After the infernal chopsticks embarrassed me as I dropped food on the table over and over again, I started project Chop-X. With my father’s help, I developed a well-designed prototype after numerous attempts and hundreds of hours at a local workshop. To my surprise, I was not the only one who could benefit from it. After learning about patients who suffered severe hand injuries, resulting in difficulties using normal tableware, I made more copies of Chop-X and showed patients how to use it in the hospital. Hearing them say “Thank you for making us feel normal again” made me realize what I could do with my limited but practical knowledge.The mechanism of Chop-X, based on elementary school physics, might be laughable in front of cutting-edge innovations and probably won’t make me a millionaire inventor. But it represents why I want to study engineering: to help the disadvantaged minorities with practical scientific knowledge. ;The College of Engineering at CMU is an ideal place for me to become the type of engineer I want to be. The 24-series courses will provide me with many opportunities to gain hand-on experience through learning the operations of different machines and building “soft robots” and other prototypes in the Machine Shop.  ;Moreover, I am attracted to the Robotics Institute (RI), where I can find a wide array of research projects focused on applying robotics to aid our lives. Particularly, I am inspired by the projects aimed to solve easily ignored problems such as the “Hand Held Force Magnifier” that would enhance the accuracy of delicate surgeries or the “Assistive Robots for Blind Travelers” to aid the blind. By pursuing a minor in RI, and interacting with the professors I hope to get involved with research projects and develop ideas where I can use robotics to improve Chop-X, and gain inspiration for future endeavors. ;CMU’s volunteer opportunities are abundant, from the Volunteer Fair to numerous clubs and organizations, giving me the opportunity to become a socially engaged engineer. I look forward to using the knowledge I learn from CMU to contribute in programs like Global Medical Brigades or Engineers Without Boarders, to help make an impact in improving the lives of the disadvantaged. ;At CMU, not only can I become an engineer that is knowledgeable enough to solve a problem, handy enough to create a solution, but also have the opportunity to give aid to those who needs it most. ;"

    "CommonApp": "When I was four, my father gave me my first set of 3D puzzle. Since then, I have been enthralled by these magical pieces that are cut out of flat wood pieces and cardboard yet can form into any tridimensional model I wanted: animals, vehicles, buildings, and more. Witnessing my immersion into this new hobby my father realized that I had inherited his genes.  As an engineer himself, he took advantage of every opportunity when some appliance in the house needed fixing, to show me the mechanisms and engineering principals behind them. Even though I had no idea what he was talking about most of the time then, I enjoyed spending time with him, seeing his glow of excitement while explaining fanatically with his pen and sketch paper. We also built lots of small gadgets together in our free time: a mini racing car, a night-light in a chocolate box, a spring driven wheel, and many other silly things. For the last 10 years, my father has worked as an administrator for the Department of Local Technology Development, which granted him the access to many local innovations such as paper-like electronic books, small robot guard dogs, bone-conduction earphones, cloud computing and 3D printing technology. Playing around with these products without instructions was always an adventure for me; where amazing and mysterious functions awaits my discovery. At home, there was never a shortage of new toys for me to play with, take apart, and reverse engineer. When the embarrassment of not knowing how to use chopsticks properly forced me to try out a long existing idea of making a pair of simplified chopsticks, my father helped me explore the process of bringing an idea to life. With a little guidance I found workshops that would make stainless steel legs for me, resources to study the process of patent filing, and learned to use a 3D modeling software for my design. I hit a lot of bumps along the road but eventually I was able to create something of great use and meaning to me. While this pair of modified chopsticks, Chop-X, was originally intended to serve myself, I unexpectedly found an audience that had the need for it when I was volunteering at senior center of elderly people who had severe hand injuries. This unexpected outcome enriched my understanding of engineering: that it is a magical bridge that connects inventor’s enjoyment of exploration and user’s benefits and convenience. Growing up in a “wonderland of technology”, I was inspired to become an engineer and inventor. I loved the process of exploring the hidden ideas of my mind and figuring out how to substantiate them. My dream is to continue to use my creativity and imagination to create things that can benefit society or simply bring convenience to people’s lives.",

As I explained that the leverage was more efficient and the spoon easier to control using my way, I was called a geek. ;Besides these geeky and nerdy sides of me, I think I am more of a geek because I am really interested in gadgets; I would break apart a nail clipper to understand the mechanics, and spent years thinking about how to solve my chopstick problems, which lead to the birth of Chop-X.Maybe my knowledge is not yet in-depth enough to be a scientific geek, but I think I am on the way to become one."

    "CommonApp": "In primary school, my classmates started to call me “mommy.” At first, I was confused by the title. Other than the fact that I was taller and older than most of my peers, I viewed myself as just a typical kid. But I soon learned the nickname was a result of others recognizing my responsible nature and more adult mannerisms. Soon, I began to take a private, strange pride in the nickname, excited by the fact that others saw me as poised and mature.  ‘I have to live up to this title’, I decided. Thus, I became a model student, working extra hard for A’s in every class; a responsible citizen, I swept our classroom’s floor for twenty minutes after school; a supportive companion, I listened to my friends complain about their parents late into the night, even as I struggled to combat my drooping eyelids. I did everything I could to make myself worthy of this “crown.”My “mommy” nickname followed me to middle school. This time, however, it didn’t sound as pleasant. As my peers pursued the latest fashions and listened to Eason Chan and Britney Spears, they were often surprised to find that I, too, enjoyed listening to rock music in my spare time. They had just assumed that I listened to the Mozart and Beethoven that their parents enjoyed. I began to realize that my pursuit for poise and maturity had brought with it unexpected social stigmas and misconceptions, even from some of my closest friends. Thus, I began trying to break free of the mommy label. I joined the school softball team; I performed in the comedy show; I did everything I could in an attempt to say “ Hey guys!

    "Supps": "题目：Contemporary higher education reflects a tension between preparing for a meaningful life and preparing for a career. What are you looking for in your undergraduate education? Which emphasis is more important to you at this time and why?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          In college I’m looking for answers.Is there an ultimate meaning for the universe? And if it turns out to be “42” as proposed in the Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, what should we do?Can Brownian motion explain the principles of the universe?Does all literature on Earth have a common source, like Gilgamesh to The Iliad and The Odyssey?Are we born good or evil? Can good and evil even be a standard for judgment?Niebuhr once said, “God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.” But how can I know the difference?Is my life predetermined, or susceptible to my free will?Should I continue with the Mathematics that I’ve always been good at, or should I further my passions in religion, politics, and philosophy?In college I’m looking for friends.We can travel to Spain to visit the buildings of Gaudi and to Italy to see the fresco paintings of the confident, independent, and beautiful Etruscan women.We can freely talk about our ambitions and dreams late into the night, paying full attention to and respecting each other’s words.We can trust each other after stepping into society, knowing we always have someone to lean on.We will continue writing to and visiting each other after we achieve our life goals.In college I am looking for challengers.People who question me and drive me to grow stronger.People who stimulate my morale and keep me moving on.People who may be different from me, but from whom I can still appreciate and learn from.All of these things and people that I am looking for will not be constrained by a single career. They spread into every corner of my life, and help me grow and discover who I really am.One career, one application of what I learn from them, cannot fully represent my whole picture. Maybe I’ll follow my father’s path, studying Mathematics. Maybe I’ll be a social entrepreneur after graduation. Maybe I’ll be a cello teacher in my sixties. Attending college for me is not about one career. It is about discovering my true self, and equipping me to live a life that is meaningful, colorful, and happy. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Many human beings throughout history have found inspiration and joy in literature and works of art. Is there a book, play, poem, movie, painting, music selection, or photograph that has been especially meaningful to you?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I have grown up with “3 Idiots.” ;When I was eleven, my primary school head teacher played us the movie “3 Idiots.” The protagonist, Rancho, inspires two of his former classmates, Farhan and Maju, to chase their dreams instead of following the crowd and conforming to their parents. ;Rancho’s braveness and passion not only inspired Farhan, but also inspired me through the screen. “Pursue your dream,” I told myself, “don’t worry and go for what you want. That’s what you are born for.”At that time, I did have a fantastic new dream. I had recently started playing the cello after my mom had taken me to a Yoyo Ma concert. During the three-hour concert, I had fallen deeply in love with cello. As I played, I imagined the gorgeous, graceful sounds of Yoyo Ma’s cello coming from my cello and bow.However, I soon found achieving this fantasy difficult. For a whole year, most of the sounds coming from my cello were dull and lifeless at best. What was wrong with my dream? Did I not love it deeply enough? ;Confused, I revisited the movie. This time, I discovered something I hadn’t previously noticed: the success the three students had achieved was not only the result of a dream or fleeting passion. It required fortitude and perseverance. ;Rancho became successful because he refused to simply daydream about his goals. He even goes so far as to disguise himself, so that he can overcome his social status and get a college degree. Likewise, Farhan does not become a wildlife photographer simply by hoping his dream would come true. Rather, creates a wall of animal pictures in his home, and secretly shoots photos of them against his father’s will. To accomplish their dreams, they had to work unbelievably hard, doing things that others may have called crazy or even idiotic.In that moment, I finally understood the title of the movie and how it related to my dreams. To become great at cello, passion and inspiration would not be enough. I needed to practice a lot, a crazy amount, to achieve my goals. I need to become an idiot for my dream.Now I’ve become the first cellist in my orchestra. I’ve become more familiar with my cello, though there is still much room for improvement. Now, I have learned that a dream will forever be a dream if I didn’t fight for it."

    "CommonApp": "In primary school, my classmates started to call me “mommy.” At first, I was confused by the title. Other than the fact that I was taller and older than most of my peers, I viewed myself as just a typical kid. But I soon learned the nickname was a result of others recognizing my responsible nature and more adult mannerisms. Soon, I began to take a private, strange pride in the nickname, excited by the fact that others saw me as poised and mature.  ‘I have to live up to this title’, I decided. Thus, I became a model student, working extra hard for A’s in every class; a responsible citizen, I swept our classroom’s floor for twenty minutes after school; a supportive companion, I listened to my friends complain about their parents late into the night, even as I struggled to combat my drooping eyelids. I did everything I could to make myself worthy of this “crown.”My “mommy” nickname followed me to middle school. This time, however, it didn’t sound as pleasant. As my peers pursued the latest fashions and listened to Eason Chan and Britney Spears, they were often surprised to find that I, too, enjoyed listening to rock music in my spare time. They had just assumed that I listened to the Mozart and Beethoven that their parents enjoyed. I began to realize that my pursuit for poise and maturity had brought with it unexpected social stigmas and misconceptions, even from some of my closest friends. Thus, I began trying to break free of the mommy label. I joined the school softball team; I performed in the comedy show; I did everything I could in an attempt to say “ Hey guys! I am just the same as you!”Still “mommy” remained. Soon, the crown that I had once so proudly worn felt like an unwanted weight. I was just a young and callow adolescent, naïve and fallible. Yet whatever I did, I felt people expected me to perform with “mommy’s” perfection and maturity. I expressed my discomfort to my friends several time, but none of them took it seriously.

    "Supps": "题目：Student self-governance, which encourages student investment and initiative, is a hallmark of the U.Va. culture. In her fourth year at U.Va., Laura Nelson was inspired to create Flash Seminars, one-time classes which facilitate high-energy discussion about thought-provoking topics outside of traditional coursework. If you created a Flash Seminar, what idea would you explore and why?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          When the results of 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature came out, I was a little surprised to see the Chinese novelist, Mo Yan, as the winner. His famous work, Red Sorghum, didn’t leave much impression on me when I read it in Chinese, His language felt unnecessarily ornate, sometimes leaving his true meaning obscure and hard for me to resonate with. Confused, I investigated the official Nobel website and found that it was in fact the English translations of Mo’s novels that won the prize. As a translator for my school magazine, I know how important translation is, and that it truly can build or kill an article. I began to wonder what role did the translation play in Mo’s case?I found Red Sorghum in English and soon was filled with admiration for the translator, Howard Goldblatt, who delicately introduced more profound themes into the book. In the words of William Faulkner, it ‘appealed to our universal bones - made us laugh, cry, think, and sigh.’This revelation drove me to thinking about the critical role of translation that permeates every aspect of my life. Having an idea and presenting it to others is a translation. Acquiring information and explaining it is a translation. Debating, negotiating, and propagandizing are all translations. In my Flash Seminar, I will explore with my peers the art of translation in all of its forms. We will discover the deeper truth of translation as it relates to better understanding literature, communication and human interactions.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：College of Arts and Sciences - What work of art, music, science, mathematics, or literature has surprised, unsettled, or challenged you, and in what way?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          During our first experiment in ‘Dynamic Physics’, we observed the motion of pollen grains in a beaker of water. They moved according to Chaos Theory - completely random and unpredictable. As I continued observing, I felt a connection between the pollen and myself. From the perspective of an omnipotent giant, we humans probably seem identical to these rambling pollen grains. There is no way to know how big an influence today’s smallest decision will have on the future. Who’d have guessed that Yoyo Ma concert seven years ago would lead to a lifelong love of cello? A change in lunch plans, a stroll in the park; everything in my life may be a turning point that completely alters my future trajectory. Where am I going? What will I be? Totally unknown. ;Then, I took a second look at the pollen. This time, it looked different. Though the grains traveled randomly, there was always a limit - the water. The pollen may move an inch down or two inches up, but it could never escape the beaker. It is the same for me. I might transform into a teacher, a cellist, an ambassador, or an environmental advocate, but I will always be the girl who loves interacting with people, giving to society, and challenging the old me. My characteristics are my water: they are intrinsic and guide my every movement. My future may move according to chaos dynamics, but with my water, I can exist in harmonious equilibrium."

    "CommonApp": "My living room, with its familiar coffee table and couches perfect for curling up with a book. The orchestra room at school, with its rows of cellos and rickety stands. On the surface, the two places have little in common, yet both places give me the same warm feeling of belonging and contentment. And it is all because of a set of hammers, strings, and music’s ability to transcend time and cultures.Piano has always been a large part of my life, from peeking up at my older sister’s fingers brushing the black and white keys to mastering pieces of my own. This collection of wood and ivory represents much more than just an instrument to me. Each time I sit at a piano and indulge myself— eyes closed, fingers dancing across the keys as my body sways to the rhythms—my mind fills with memories of my passion.Attending the Jacobs School of Music Piano Academy two summers ago, I was humbled by the opportunity to keep company with sixty of the nation’s finest pianists and international students. There, refreshingly stimulating conversations revolved around favorite composers, the most difficult techniques, and different styles. There, my musical knowledge broadened as we attended daily master classes and nightly concerts featuring some of the most talented musicians worldwide. There, I understood how music really is the universal communicator. When I chatted with my friend who lived in Korea her entire life, I found that the language barrier melted away as we chatted about repertoire we had in common and how to master octaves. The practical verbal communication of words and sentences, though dominant in our everyday world, is enriched by music’s ability to allow expression of our feelings on a different level.The inspiration I found at the Piano Academy created the perfect launching point for my piano exam less than a year later. In the weeks leading to my performance, I was predominantly concerned with perfecting my technique. However, in the moments before my performance, I focused less on the testing component and more on this rare opportunity to share and communicate my music with two individuals who were as passionate about music as I am. I wanted the judges to feel the Classical Period’s elegance and refinement through my Mozart Sonata, and the idyllic water scene of my Barcarolle. Each piece resonates differently with each person, and I wanted the judges to understand my perspective from the years I spent making those pieces mine. This performance stands out in my mind as one of my best, not because of the pressure or my results, but because I left everything behind, entered my music, and simply enjoyed each note, as I have consistently ever since.Music has been one of my most enduring teachers. Being a musician has taught me about poise, stage-presence, and fully appreciating critiques. Whenever I get the results from my latest festival, it is not my place or the number of points I earned that has me waiting in anticipation. Instead, I eagerly look for what the judges took from my interpretation, and whether my perspective shined through. After years of comments, I know there are many views, often contradicting, of a single performance, each with its own merit that I take to heart. Music is a learning process that continues forever, and that is what makes this art so special to me.My love of how music adds so much color to our lives and my personal growth from studying piano has been such a defining part of my life since my childhood. Through piano, I have found contentment in a unique avenue of expression. Only more places will join my living room and the school orchestra room as I continue my journey with piano, bringing this contentment to other times and places in my life.",

Reflect on an idea or experience that has been important to your intellectual development.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          “What’s your favorite subject?”Until this past summer, I confidently answered “AP Chemistry”. While I loved contributing to Othello discussions in class, sciences and their hands-on applicability to everyday life had always been more appealing. However, the Stanford Summer Humanities Institute (SHI) welcomed me into a completely new dimension of thought.At SHI, each conversation was an intelligent exchange, whether we discussed the day’s lecture or debated the merits of public versus private schools. The boundaries of my mind rapidly expanded from the start, when we considered what fictions do to us. Despite my prolific reading, I had never considered how I genuinely care for fictional characters. Each day brought new and often conflicting concepts of how to re-enchant or draw meaning from our lives. Best of all, we could explore any topic more in-depth, culminating in a ten-page discourse.SHI was the catalyst for transforming my previous notion of humanities. I realized the humanities add another dimension of color, such as Nietzsche’s world view, to the precise world of science. Nietzsche perceived two opposing forces acting together—chaotic Dionysian forces of ugly reality and aesthetic Apollonian forces that beautify Dionysian disorder. Humanities are my enriching Apollonian force, focusing attention in new places: interactions with fictional characters, movies, book rereadings. I plan on further developing this force into a lens to view the world. Philosophy is now a favorite subject, and I will continue searching for other lenses in college as I embrace my new identity as a humanities-science hybrid.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus.

I’ve always loved reading and find it so fun to shape and manipulate the English language. Reading is definitely one of my guilty pleasures, and I’m prone to having books and miscellaneous bookmarks scattered everywhere (I promise to be neater in our dorm!).

    "CommonApp": "I put the dough in the oven, turn the timer to ten-minutes, and wait for the final product –chocolate muffins. The kitchen room looks messy: glasses and bowls scattered about and different types of ingredients everywhere. Nevertheless, I enjoy it. When I put cocoa in, I was putting another Coco – myself (my English name) –into it too. I sit in front of the oven expectantly while my father, never attracted by the scent permeating the room, is working. I started baking at eighth grade wishing to try something new. When I first invited my parents to join, they did not understand. “Why wasting three hours on meaningless activities?” They classified things by their usefulness and concluded I would not get anything from “baking-a-cake”, a typical utilitarian attitude adopted by Chinese parents. I used to spend all the time doing “meaningful things” defined by them, but that did not make me happy. I disliked being forced to play the piano for tests because, well, it was forced, or jogging at night because I couldn’t calm down. However I enjoyed baking in this cozy kitchen– the aroma of vanilla, the golden-color of butter, and the tenderness of muffin. Yet how can I pursue deliciousness full-heartedly without exploring the rationales behind recipes? The rustling sounds from the oven capture my attention: the dough begins to grow mushroom-shaped. This reminds me of odd-shaped results from experiments conducted in this kitchen that fulfilled my curiosity.  “Why should we separate yolks from egg whites before stirring?” I wondered, so I experimented. The golden mishmash danced with my egg-mixer, splashing, spinning, shining. “Looks good”, I thought, but this didn't last long. The dark-yellow mud-like paste completely destructed my anticipation with the cake failing to rise. I ate my failure as usual –unforgettably “tasty”. Later I learned that letting air permeate the materials by separating the ingredients was essential. I also wondered why use low-gluten flour but not the strong one, so I experimented. The final product was surprisingly a Chinese-style oven roll! I shared it with my parents and apparently they liked it better.  As I dug more, however, I felt off-focus. Sometimes life is simply what it is. We can’t rationalize “beautiful” or “tasty”: rationales don’t matter anymore. A faint fragrance of lotus-nuts occupies the kitchen. This is not a common smell for a muffin. I put the lotus-nuts to balance with the greasy butter inside, even though my mother disagreed. As I unintentionally baked the Chinese snack, my mother seemed to grow curious about baking experiments. After having her first baking venture, she found the process of keeping everything accurate captivating. This time she joined me. “One spoon of sugar with 30g butter.” She read recipes out loud, strictly following every instruction. “We need innovations.” but I told her. “Apple succeeded out of creativity, and an apple pie needs it, too.” Previously, inspired by the jelly-making process, I attempted to combine jelly with baking. “Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could have a jelly-cake, with several layers of different flavors?” I could not wait to try. After careful calculation and stirring, I turned on the oven. The waiting time was incredibly long and thousands of good or bad possibilities popped out in my mind. A burnt cake? An exploding oven? I had no idea. When it was finished, I fell in love with its rainbow-like appearance and mixed taste. Excited, I shared it with my parents and friends, hoping to receive some compliments. “A better way is to buy jellies from supermarket and eat them together.” My father laughed. Well, only I knew what my father had missed. It was the excitement of an idea, the anxiety of waiting, and the joy of success. Ding! A triumphant sound of the oven awakens me. I am ready to enjoy the hectic pleasure of the muffin, embracing the baking world of mine in this cozy kitchen.",
    "Supps": "题目：How have your interests and related experiences influenced the major you have selected in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences? (Please limit your response to 650 words.)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          The first thing I learned about Cornell was the word “Ithacating”, which referred to something unidentifiable falling from the sky. As a person who appreciates snowy days so much, “Ithacating” might turn into a pleasant surprise. Indeed, I expect my journey in the College of Arts and Sciences to be ithacating too. The nice yet unidentifiable future means I can explore a diversity of enjoyable fields.My interest in educational policies and schooling was first ignited during interaction with American volunteers. As a group of volunteer teachers, we came together to discuss our own education experiences. The large discrepancy between two nations’ education structures shocked me. In my view, American education seems to cultivate more creative thinking while the Chinese one favors potential researchers. One thing that is seriously lacking in the Chinese educational system is the lack of real-world engagement; there are certain drawbacks to other systems too. Recognizing the importance of education in everyone’s life, I hope to research this topic and form a better structure for future pupils. Therefore, the focus on educational policies of Cornell’s sociology department attracts me. I would like to take related courses such as Schooling and Society. Led by Professor Kendra Bischoff, I can discuss the effect of schooling on students’ personal growth, the exact field where I want to dig further. Through these courses, I expect myself to be able to identify the relationship between schooling policy and social outcomes of students from different ethnicities and socioeconomic classes. In this way, I am confident that I can design more effective educational policy that generates maximum social outcomes. Indeed, I can work as a volunteer teacher in local schools around Cornell to “test out” some of my beliefs.Another academic interest of mine is in ethics. I still remember the talk during a MUN conference regarding the legitimate rights of immigrants, when I had my first discussion about ethics.Let’s try to improve the conditions of immigrant workers since we are always cooperating with each other. I propose…Why WASTE money? Fire them and benefit our citizens.But simply dismissing them is not what a MORAL nation will do…Other delegates and I disagreed about the way to treat immigrant workers. While I justified retaining them to minimize the damage, my teammates supported the “layoff” policy. Thinking further, I became increasingly curious about ethics. How do people react to ethical dilemmas, such as should we sacrifice an innocent person to save five others? How do individual decisions vary with circumstances? Can we justify the majority rule? All these questions brought me to the field of ethics and how it affects public policy. Therefore, Cornell’s Program on Ethics and Public Life attracts me. Specific courses such as Ethics and Health Care, Ethical Theory attract me. I hope to have a close interaction with Professor Kate Manne. Her research focus on virtue ethics and the relationship between normative ethics and an agent's political circumstances perfect fits my interest. I believe she can inspire and help me to search the answers of questions I have been curious about for long.Cornell CAS represents opportunities to explore a wide range of fields and pursue my true interests with freedom. I believe the College of Arts and Sciences is definitely going to be a significant platform to actualize my ambition."

    "CommonApp": "I loathe wandering in a shopping mall not knowing what to buy; I cannot start a project without detailed planning; I feel lost entering a new week without a full calendar of responsibilities.This is likely how I have always ended up the model student, where thoroughly complete assignments and proper manners never evade my grasp, and why my parents do not worry about me, leaving me to my own decision-making. This attitude remained effective even when I arrived at Mercersburg Academy and gained recognition for my efficiency and effort. And with this affirmation, I became an even stronger believer in my principles.During the annual introductions of various spring break programs, I was drawn to the 6-day Grand Canyon trip. I remembered the photos my dad showed me from his trip eight years ago. They were indeed beautiful, and he told me it was an unforgettable experience, encouraging me to go. Without much thought, I signed up.“What the heck did I get myself into?” I grumbled as I pulled one of my legs out of the knee-deep snow, only to bury the other one even deeper. Just hours ago I was groaning about my blistered heels, but now I couldn’t even feel them. It was the third day, yet I had not washed my hair once, which was now gross and sticky enough to trap mosquitoes. I also gave up brushing my teeth since the water was freezing. At night, I slept with my socks and shoes on, so I didn’t have to put them on again, slimy and cold.As I lay there, I wondered how I let this disaster happen, recounting all the preparation I had done. I brought three pairs of socks while everyone else brought two. Knowing that there would be no place to shower, I brought shampoo so I could at least rinse my hair in the river. I even bought a pair of spikes, so I could better traverse the icy trail.Naturally, I began wondering how I could have prepared better, before realizing there’s really no way to prepare for ice water seeping in under the tent. I simply didn’t belong here, where all principle and logic went out the window.On the fourth day, as I was ready to leave this nightmare, we began our climb at 4 a.m. to Plateau Point. It was dark when we arrived, and quiet except for the incessant rush of the Colorado River. Once again, I asked myself life’s biggest question—why am I here?Though originally imperceptible in the darkness, something began to take form. The river became noticeably wild under the gentle beam of morning light, and the Colorado River began to show its sinuous shape, carrying that brightness towards us. Meanwhile, I gazed on as the sky gradually turned from purple to pink, above the gilded outlines of the mountains in the horizon, until the sun broke through with its immense energy, eradicating any remaining shadows with its vigor.At that point, I forgot about my greasy hair, my stinky shirt, and my soaked socks. The scene was magnificent, even if I had seen the same image in photos many times. There was something about being there that moment, partially dazed, filthy, and standing in wet socks, which made it so much more awe—inspiring. I could understand what my father meant now by it being an “unforgettable experience”. It wasn’t the ease and comfort of the trip, or the beautiful scenery, that he wanted me to experience. He meant for me to endure the struggles he protected me from, to appreciate the splendors of struggling through uncertainties and chaos that we cannot plan for, and shouldn’t plan for. “Don’t be afraid of breaking rules or of the unexpected. Embrace it.” He told me with a chuckle.",
    "Supps": "题目：Considering your lifetime goals, discuss how your current and future academic and extra-curricular activities might help you achieve your goals. (500 words)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          My dream is to build the ultimate robot that can go beyond the limitations of today’s robots, to build a robot that can replace all kinds of human rescue operations in extreme emergency conditions. Instead of just detecting radioactive water leaks two years too late, I believe robots of the future should be able to save victims in disasters and circumstances where human rescuers cannot access.At age 15, I proposed to study in the United States alone. In the United States, I discovered the thrill of American football; with my body covered with mud and my face covered with opponents’ sweat, I ran as fast as could with the olive-shaped ball with three 200-pound athletes chasing me. Waking up to the beautiful sunrise in my sleeping bag with no clean shirt and socks to wear, I learned to slow down and appreciate the natural beauty of the snowy valley in the Grand Canyon, before continuing my bag-packing trip across the Bright Angel Creek. Swinging the racquet as hard as I can while sprinting around the squash court, I had no idea that squash would be ‘the sport’ I was to be good at. All the risks that I took and all the explorations I made gradually became part of my life.That’s why, with no experience in robot making or even computer science, I decided to participate in Robocup Junior. Hours were spent building our robots from Lego Pieces, days writing programming code to direct the robots, weeks combing the code for errors and painstakingly correcting every one. As I dived into the world of robotics, I found out that the creating robots is a continuous process of self-improvement; I was attracted to the precise logic but inapproachability of perfection. There was always something to be improved upon. Even after my robot completed a task perfectly, I could always try to simplify the coding even more or make the hardware more efficient. I was addicted to robots, not only because it was ‘cool’ and ‘awesome’, but because of its potential implication in the future world as they are equipped to perform the most ambitious tasks.Robots can potentially do things that humans cannot. In cases of extreme emergent conditions, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, or disastrous malfunctions of nuclear power plants, humans are often left hapless and restricted by the physical nature of their bodies. ;Currently, robots are typically the alternative to humans (except for specialized monotonous tasks) because of their limited mobility and ability to problem-solve. With my study of electrical engineering, I want to contribute to building the next generation of robots, capable of performing all kinds of rescue and dangerous missions, even under extreme conditions. In addition to these responsibilities, my vision for robots in the future is one where robots have meld with many aspects of our daily lives, bringing safety and convenience to us all."

Start from measure 32 please.” The memory of practice during the first year was still horrifying. Unable to read music fast enough, I always made mistakes and there was nowhere to hide: everyone heard the wrong notes. The conductor pointed them out in front of the entire band and hummed the beats for me. He stood on his toes, leaned forward and opened his arms when it was fortissimo; relaxed and closed his eyes when it was piano.This is the most serious group in school. Every member is passionate about music and wanting to make the band better. Throughout the year, I started to familiarize myself with the band, especially during percussion section. When someone played a song on the marimba, I would pick up my sticks and started playing along with the melody on the drum set. Though being a drummer, I was also curious about timpani, vibraphone, and chime, like a little kid in a candy store. As the practice time racked up, I start to feel the other aspect of the band: caring. My role was also changing, from the new kid to the group to now the elderly who takes care of the new comers. Standing in front of the band, I am not longer bothered by the horrified practices. It is now my job to lead this band to give the best performances and play the heart felt music we always do. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe the unique qualities that attract you to the specific undergraduate College or School (including preferred admission and dual degree programs) to which you are applying at the University of Michigan.

Despite the hard work, participating students are never tired of it because of their passion, which keeps them pursuing their interests, challenging themselves, and exerting their fullest commitment. I look forward to be part of this program because I believe that Ross School of Business will provide me with a global vision and analytical mindset while College of Engineering will polish my constructing and modeling expertise, helping me to further pursue my robot dream.The sensor based robot project has become my addiction and I have spent hundreds of hours in the robotics lab to establish communication between processors, to work on a robot that could identify “victims” in a maze and to find its way back to the starting point. And last summer, every afternoon after the internship in Prudential Plc in the morning, I went to the Chinese University of Hong Kong and attended lectures on value based leadership and management, and entrepreneur. These past experiences not only rich my knowledge, but also inspire me to explore further in the university.The combination of Ross and COE gives me the opportunities to pursue two things I am truly passionate about. In Ross, all sorts of competitions and programs are offered such as The Target Case Study Competition, and Undergraduate Intercollegiate Stock Pitch Competition. The variety of these business related programs will help me familiarize with the world of business and finance through applying theoretical knowledge in the real life, giving me the opportunity to learn from real world business even before my career starts. In addition, community service program such as MReach will allow me to work with younger students with their business knowledge and ideas, something that I have done in high school and wish to continue in college. Besides the intellectual and analytical, the entrepreneurial aspect of Ross also encourages me to explore the application and potential of sensor based rescue robots in the real market place. Furthermore, COE’s Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) allows me to work on research projects with other research scientists and students, giving me the chance to further develop my idea of rescue robots. Applying what I learn in both schools, I can even choose research project on financial engineering, which is what I want to pursue after college.I can’t think about anything that is better than this dual degree program. It has everything that I am looking into, and I know that if I have an opportunity to be in this program, I shouldn’t miss it."

    "CommonApp": "I come from a world that appreciates taking risks and exploring the unknown. My dad, an engineer who taught himself to become an architect, believes in the power of ‘Figuring it out yourself’. Even in elementary school, my dad would ask me to assemble the newly purchased furniture without worrying about me breaking the furniture or getting hurt in the process. He would simply leave me alone with the tools and pieces and then go watch TV. My mom, who trained in traditional Chinese medicine, but worked hard to eventually become a retinal surgeon, always encouraged me to pursue new ideas and places, supporting my participation in overseas summer exchange programs and my choice to play the rambunctious drums. My parents showed me the potential of taking risks and exploration, shaping a large part of the person I am. So at age 15, when I proposed to study in the United States alone, everyone was shocked except for my parents. I knew they were proud of me.The moment that I stepped onto the Mercersburg campus was like stepping into a whole new world. It gave me the chance to explore with independent and experimental projects. Though suffering two broken bones in the process, I discovered the thrill of American football. With my body covered with mud and my face covered with opponents’ sweat, I ran as fast as could with the olive-shaped ball with three 200-pound athletes chasing me. Waking up to the beautiful sunrise in my sleeping bag with no clean shirt and socks to wear, I learned to slow down and appreciate the natural beauty of the snowy valley in the Grand Canyon, before continuing my bag-packing trip across the Bright Angel Creek. Swinging the racquet as hard as I can while sprinting around the squash court, I had no idea that squash would be ‘the sport’ I was to be good at. All the risks that I took and all the explorations I made gradually became part of my life.With no experience in robot making or even computer science, I participated in the robot challenge, attracted to its precise logic and inapproachability of perfection. There was always something to be improved upon. Even after my robot completed a task perfectly, I could always try to simplify the coding even more or make the hardware more efficient. I was addicted to robots, not only because it was ‘cool’ and ‘awesome’, but because of its potential implication in the future world as they are equipped to perform the most ambitious tasks.My dream is to build the ultimate robot that can replace all kinds of human rescue operations in extreme emergent conditions. Instead of just detecting life signs, I believe robots of the future should be able to save victims in disasters and circumstances where human rescuers cannot access. In order to achieve this dream of mine, I intend to continue pursuing risks as they present themselves, and keep exploring the unknown for more.",
    "Supps": "题目：Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience that is important to you. What about this quality or accomplishment makes you proud and how does it relate to the person you are?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I struck the cymbals at full force with both drumsticks, concluding the performance with two powerful crashes. Even though out of breath, I left my arms raised in the air like a rock star, waiting for the audience to burst into applause and cheers. It was better than the hundreds of times I dreamed it.A month earlier, practicing the Mission: Impossible theme song for the annual Pop Concert literally seemed like an impossible mission for me. The speed of the song was too fast for my ability and the rhythm was unorthodox from other songs I have played. To make matters worse, I was also assigned a fifteen-second freestyle solo that I had no clue what to do with.Each time I arrived at my solo during practice, I would lose rhythm and mislead the entire Jazz band into an off-tempo disaster. Each time we would end with our flustered conductor yelling, “Stop!” ;Finally, when he could not tolerate the beats from my drums any longer, our conductor bluntly told me, “Philip, for the sake of the band, why don’t you just play something easy? Keep the band on the right track please. You are not on Otto’s level yet.” It was not the first time the conductor showed how much he missed Otto, the senior drummer from last year.His words stung, but became my best motivation. I started to carry a pair of drumsticks wherever I went. In class, I would rap on my desk with the sticks up until teachers arrived. On my way to the dinner hall, I would beat incessantly on the lockers. Where there were no objects, I conveniently tapped on the backs of friends on our way back to the dorms, to their annoyance. Whenever I felt the need for an audience, I ventured the dorm halls, sharing the exciting drumbeats with floor mates. Quickly, they would grow annoyed with me for playing the same beats again and again, finally chasing me back to my room, where my roommate continued to suffer. ;In my free time, I would sneak into the practice room to work on different combinations, trying to perfect my solo. Beats were all I could think of.The week before the performance, I finally came up with my idea of the perfect solo. Drawing inspiration (and courage) from countless ten-minute Travis Barker solos on YouTube, I devised an ambitious piece at twice the rhythm of the rest of the song. It was the kind of solo that would awe the crowd with a fury of drumbeats while melding smoothly with the entire band’s rhythm.“That was the best live solo I have heard. Otto will be proud of you.” The conductor told me after the performance. ;I smiled, finally. Not only because I have met his expectations, but because my tireless practice has enabled me to play a memorable piece of music for the audience."

This attitude remained effective even when I arrived at Mercersburg Academy and gained recognition for my efficiency and effort. And with this affirmation, I became an even stronger believer in my principles.During the annual introductions of various spring break programs, I was drawn to the 6-day Grand Canyon trip. I remembered the photos my dad showed me from his trip eight years ago. They were indeed beautiful, and he told me it was an unforgettable experience, encouraging me to go. Without much thought, I signed up.“What the heck did I get myself into?” I grumbled as I pulled one of my legs out of the knee-deep snow, only to bury the other one even deeper. Just hours ago I was groaning about my blistered heels, but now I couldn’t even feel them. It was the third day, yet I had not washed my hair once, which was now gross and sticky enough to trap mosquitoes. I also gave up brushing my teeth since the water was freezing. At night, I slept with my socks and shoes on, so I didn’t have to put them on again, slimy and cold.As I lay there, I wondered how I let this disaster happen, recounting all the preparation I had done. I brought three pairs of socks while everyone else brought two. Knowing that there would be no place to shower, I brought shampoo so I could at least rinse my hair in the river. I even bought a pair of spikes, so I could better traverse the icy trail.Naturally, I began wondering how I could have prepared better, before realizing there’s really no way to prepare for ice water seeping in under the tent. I simply didn’t belong here, where all principle and logic went out the window.On the fourth day, as I was ready to leave this nightmare, we began our climb at 4 a.m. to Plateau Point. It was dark when we arrived, and quiet except for the incessant rush of the Colorado River. Once again, I asked myself life’s biggest question—why am I here?Though originally imperceptible in the darkness, something began to take form. The river became noticeably wild under the gentle beam of morning light, and the Colorado River began to show its sinuous shape, carrying that brightness towards us. Meanwhile, I gazed on as the sky gradually turned from purple to pink, above the gilded outlines of the mountains in the horizon, until the sun broke through with its immense energy, eradicating any remaining shadows with its vigor.At that point, I forgot about my greasy hair, my stinky shirt, and my soaked socks. The scene was magnificent, even if I had seen the same image in photos many times. There was something about being there that moment, partially dazed, filthy, and standing in wet socks, which made it so much more awe—inspiring. I could understand what my father meant now by it being an “unforgettable experience”. It wasn’t the ease and comfort of the trip, or the beautiful scenery, that he wanted me to experience.

The interest turned to passion during the stretch of hundreds of hours I spent in the lab, establishing communication between processors so they could effectively identify \"victims\" in a simulated maze.I spent this past summer in Eindhoven for the international RoboCup competition, where robots were pitted against each other in soccer matches, and trialed in simulated disasters. Although I didn’t walk away with a trophy, I left with a realization of the underexplored potential of robotics in real-life operations. Many robots in the professional league could conquer the hostile simulated environment, identify make-believe victims, and lift them to safety, while the reality was that they were not even close to ready for real-life situations. They are supposedly the ideal alternatives to humans, but the technologies are too far behind to be effectively utilized. ;This is how my interests in Electrical and Computer Engineering emerged. At CMU’s CIT, I am excited to see that the ECE curriculum covers areas in communications, computing and networking, and data analysis. In addition, with the opportunity to minor in robotics under the Robotics Institute, I look forward to be part of projects like CMU Highly Intelligent Mobile Platform (CHIMP) in the National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC). ;The study of engineering has become more than just creating the most advanced technology. Traditional textbooks are replaced with tablets to make learning more efficient, and affordable Chromebooks are helping students in the poor areas to gain Internet access. To become a resourceful engineer, I need to go into the real world and study the challenge the non-engineers are facing. Through CMU’s Technology Consulting in the Global Community (TCinGC), I will have the opportunity to work with NGOs and schools in developing and under-resourced communities, contributing to the development of sustainable uses for information and communications technology.I am also considering supplementing my engineering plans with economics through a business minor for engineering offered by Tepper School of Business. Through my high school’s SpringBoard course in “Applied Economics” (where I created a business plan for my sushi restaurant) and my summer internships, I realized how knowledge in economics could complement other subjects. Applied science can help boost business efficiency just as businesses can effectively spread technology. From the business standpoint, I can learn to evaluate rescue robots’ technical feasibility and their commercial potential through the course “70-371 Production and Operations Management”. Additionally, student organizations like Business Technology Club (BTC) will provide me opportunities to apply technology as solutions to business problems, discovering relationships between technology and modern businesses.CMU’s combination of technological expertise, opportunity for application and chances to spread engineering around the world is the reason I am attracted to the school."

At the same time, my friends have also called me an overenthusiastic geek, when once during our preparation for the robotics competition, I stopped in the middle of my shower and entered my teammates’ room to discuss improvements for our robot. ;And it is not unusual during our disagreements for me to adamantly remain in his room, lying on his sofa with my feet on his desk, while treating myself to one of his precious coffees until I have convinced him.It is hard to categorize myself as a geek or a nerd, but with a logical mind and determination to persuade, I think it is safe to say I will fit in fine with either, along with everything else in between.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe your academic interests and how you plan to pursue them at USC.

Taking the robotics class in my high school, I was attracted to its precise logic and inapproachability of perfection. There was always something to be improved upon. Even after my robot completed a task perfectly, I could always try to simplify the coding or make the hardware more efficient. I never felt tired of robots, spending hundreds of hours in the lab to establish communication between processors, to work on a robot that could identify “victims” in a maze and to find its way back to the starting point. Therefore, in college, I want to further pursue my passion in robots.I want to explore both Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering from Viterbi before deciding on one. I was pleased to find out the wide range of robotics related courses offered in the Computer Science Department. Course such as “Sensing and Planning in Robotics” will enrich me with the applications to problems in robot mapping, perception and manipulation, polishing my constructing and modeling expertise. Moreover, the cross-lab projects and the interdisciplinary research opportunities like “Active NAO!” from the Center for Robotics and Embedded System (CRES) at the Viterbi School of Engineering will let me gain a better understanding of different research areas, from nanorobotics to humanoids, helping me to build the next generation of rescue robots with the capability to replace human in extreme rescue missions."

    "CommonApp": "“Perfect! Perfect! I want to speak perfect English!” Behind the curtains of the grand stage, I recited my speech for the last time, closely observing my competitors do the same. “Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent…” Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address.“I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons...will be able to sit down together...” Martin Luther King. “Never, never, never – in nothing, great or small, large or petty - never give in...” I found myself repeating after Churchill’s all too familiar style. “Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.” It looked like everyone had chosen speeches as famous as their original orators. Meanwhile I looked over my speech, condensed onto 4 pages of notes, entitled “English Mania”. The original speaker was Jay Walker, maybe best known as founder of priceline.com, but certainly no revolutionary. Churchill reassured me though: Never give in.Indeed, I was nervous being the only foreigner, competing in the grand finals against my talented American classmates.As I calmed myself down, the host announced, “Let us welcome junior Minghuan Noah Liu!” I stepped into the spotlight, my pounding heartbeats drowning out the audience.“Let’s talk about manias. Let’s start with Beatles mania, hysterical teenagers, crying, screaming, pandemonium. Sports mania: deafening crowds, all for one idea—get the ball in the net…” My hands were shaking, so I amplified my hand gestures to hide it. “I want to speak perfect English!”Again.“I wang-to, se-bi-ke, per-fei-k-t, Ying-ge-li-sh!” I repeated with a thick Chinese accent, mimicking Walker’s original audience.“Hahahaha!” The crowd erupted in laughter, and I could hear my best friend Alex laugh the loudest, since it was his thick Chinese accent that I impersonated.“So let us experience the passion of Chinese students’ learning English again! Perfect!” “Per-fei-k-t!”“Perfect!”“Per-fei-k-t!”I bellowed each word while my fingers pointed at the invisible but omnipresent stigmas. I recalled my purpose: to expose the reality of Chinese students.“Imagine a student taking a giant test for 3 days. Her score on this one test literally determines her future. She studies 12 hours a day for three years to prepare. And 25 percent of her grade is based on English.”Really, imagine it, Chinese students who devote as much time studying English, as a typical American student would spend on an entire day’s assignments. Yes, it is hard to deny that we are quiet and nerdy, who indeed study day and night.“That’s why this year China will become the world’s largest English-speaking country!” Everyone laughed again.But the truth is, Chinese students abhor studying as much as any other teenager. There is just no other choice.“Why English? In a single word: Opportunity. Opportunity for a better life, a job, to be able to pay for school, or put better food on the table.” The audience suddenly calmed. There is reason why Chinese students are “good at math”, “hard studiers”, and ever “soft-spoken”. They are constrained to these molds in a society that gives no second chances for those who don’t fit in the rigid system, because besides the strict path, there are no other paths—no other future. That is why they strive each day, so they don’t get left behind in a country prospering from globalization. “Like the harnessing of electricity in our cities or the fall of the Berlin Wall, English represents hope for a better future—a future where the world has its common language to solve its common problems.”With increasing number of students studying abroad, we are still just a handful chosen by chance—who do not give a full representation of the millions who continue to study and persevere daily so they can live a more respected life they deserve.",

Nevertheless, the most important thing I believe that makes me a good prefect is not my passion or enthusiasm toward my job; instead, it was responsibility. Since I know that my job was my responsibility, and if I did not finish the job well, many other people will be evolved as well, and the whole process will be slowed down. Therefore, no matter how tired I was or how much other work I have, I always finish my task nicely on time since I knew that it was my duty. ;At Oxford College, I want to participate in the Leadership Oxford program to further enhance my leadership skills in the diverse environment of Emory during my third and fourth years and possibly share my experience on public speaking with other future leaders.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Tell us something you didn't share in your admission application.

One day, when I asked them about their dream, many told me they did not have one and the rest told me “I want to earn big money.”I was devastated by their answers, so I prepared a speech to share my experience in the US. I talked about how I was able to realize my dream of helping Americans to better understand Chinese through a speech contest, and the successful stories of Bill Gates and Walt Disney. I wanted to teach them that money should not be the only driving force in pursuing their dreams.I have always thought that poverty still exists in many areas of China was because of lack of funding and support. Actually, the lack of dream was the most serious problem these children face. What they need is inspiration, not money. So this upcoming summer, I am going to go there again.

More than 25% of the time can be used for elective courses, which I look to take advantage of studying music (the history of rock and roll), communication (to learn how to present my idea in a way that can resonate with others), psychology (to learn about the reason behind human behavior), and drawing (to give myself a time for relaxing)."

    "CommonApp": "I had been waiting outside the court for like a century. Beautiful music echoing in the ballroom and professional dancers dancing elegantly and passionately, I could not enjoy all but felt so nervous that my palms had already been sweated. Here was I in the CBDF (China Ballroom Dance Federation), a national dancing competition, competing with girls and boys from professional dancing schools.  Gradually, familiar tune and graceful movements eased my stress and my mind flew back to the year when I first met Latin. John Dryden once said, dancing is the poetry of the foot. I fell in love with this kind of poetry five years ago. First at school club, then I went to the amateur dancing club for more professional training, and soon I was transferred from standard classes to advanced ones. I never thought of quitting until my favorite partner―a boy who used to be my idol―came to me and said, “Maggie, I’ve decided to quit dancing.” I was shocked. He was very talented in dancing, and I admired his speed and movements for a long time and wished to dance like him someday. Then, he told me the reason, “I was too busy with my schoolwork and was hard pressed to prepare the exams. Of course I love dancing, but study is more important.” With a sorry look, he gave a deep sigh. “You should also consider about it, Maggie. You are about to prepare for the high school entrance examinations and you don’t want to ruin it, do you?” He said sincerely, looking into my eyes. How can a person give up his love just because of study and examinations? I recalled those pictures in which my figure was reflected in the mirror with solitude beauty, and I remembered those days when I came to the club regardless of weather and illness. I danced, leaving all my troubles behind; I danced, like an ugly duckling finally grew to a grace swan; I danced, as if I were the best dancer in the world. Without dancing, I would not have been who I am now.At that moment, I knew my answer. So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, so long lives my love for dance. To balance study and dance is not easy. I have recited English words while taking a rest in the dance training, and have practiced artistic movements while being troubled by difficult math questions. With diligence and perseverance, I was admitted by my dream high school, and got the chance to take part in CBDF as a real dancer as well. Finally, the very day came. Seeing the competitive dancers who were all older than me, I was almost suffocated with stress. However, as the moment I stepped on the stage, there was nothing in my mind but dance.",

I don’t think I had any idea about environmental protection at that age, though I just didn’t like wasting. ;My desire to study environment was first aroused when I knew Roots and Shoots, an international environmental organization established by Jane Goodall in 1991. I became aware of it when I read a comic in a magazine at Grade 3, and I was totally moved by Jane’s story and was curious about this organization. The first opportunity of getting close to it came with an extracurricular class of Roots and Shoots in my middle school. During this class, we collected the recycle boxes in every office and assorted them. This activity lasted for a year, impressing me with the significance of environmental protection and inspiring my passion for environment-related activities. ;My knowledge about environment increased as I became a formal member of Roots and Shoots in high school. Its environmental activities were much more complex than those in middle school. We communicated with companies, examined whether their offices were eco-friendly enough, and then wrote reports about improvements and suggestions. Moreover, we did presentations to workers, telling them how to be eco-friendly in daily lives. ;My desire to make the earth greener grew stronger; however, I couldn’t help noticing local environment was getting worse – the excessive emission of greenhouse gases, the waste of food and energy, etc. I have to do something to make a difference.As I became the leader of Shoots and Roots, I spared no effort to promote my program called “Go Vegan, Go Green”, which aimed to make people be aware of the relationship between vegetarianism and environmental protection. It was a piece of hard work all the while. At first many people misunderstood it as a program asking people to become vegetarians. Some even doubted its value. However, my group and I never lost heart. We gave kids interesting lessons on vegetables, made exhibition boards and interactive activities to publicize our idea, and established relative software for adults. I was so glad that with our perseverance, people started to accept our opinion. ;There is a Chinese saying, “don’t fail to do something good even if it’s trivial, and don’t engage in anything bad even if it’s tiny”. Picking up a piece of litter or throwing it away, the choice is up to you. Becoming a member of Roots and Shoots and participating in so many environmental protection activities helped me realize the way my life should be and encouraged me to find my life value. I determine to study environment science, a field offers me passion and significance. Though my power may be tiny, my belief is firm. ;"

This cavern might be rather amusing to wander leisurely on a weekend, but I was alone and tired, as midnight approached.Dead-end. An old, shutdown exit.All my patience vanished as I stood there, letting anxiety and frustration accumulate in its place.

My youth seems bounded by limits.I recalled the endless dialogues before each “Club Day” performance. The age divide between teachers and students created equally divided opinions on artistic beauty. Conflicts rarely came singly and far outnumbered compromises. My role with Student Association Union placed me in the center of it all, giving rise to visions of harmony that hopelessly remained visions.

Media became more than “just about me” when I was a news anchor in the school media center, permeating students’ daily conversations with my voices. Media brings people together through commonalities found in shared ideas. The constant surprises brought by media trigger my passion for it and Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism will offer me many opportunities to explore of the world of media.Browsing through Annenberg’s site, I was attracted by it flexibility in allowing students to choose their own area of focus. Besides offering fundamental theory-basis courses, Annenberg provides undergraduates many hand-on opportunities such as finding the most creative and artistic solutions for “cool problems” about media and analyzing innovation’s impact on culture in Innovative Lab. I am especially attracted by the International Communication Study program. The opportunity to experience diversity and similarity of the media practice in Europe will help me to integrate my Chinese background with American and European visions and to understanding media on a global scale.Reading the Annenberg Student Spotlight page was like reading my own dairy: ambitious, proud, excited about what we have done and passionate about the potential in the future. With all the possibilities in Annenberg, I know I will be able to complete my definition of media."

    "Supps": "题目：1. Given your NYU campuses of interest - whether they are your primary and alternate home campuses of interest or where you would like to study away while you are a student - where, exactly, would you like to study at NYU - and why? 2. Whether you are undecided or you have a definitive plan of study in mind, what are your academic interests and how do you plan to explore them at NYU? (500 words limit combined)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          My vision of New York starts from 30 Rockefeller Plaza. ;“Live from New York, it is Saturday night!” The boisterous line is opening up to another utopia for me—Saturday Night Live. I did not get it the first time Seth Meyer made the comment during the Weekend Update, but the infectious laughter from the audience compelled me to research into politics for the first time in my life. Indeed, the electorate can be as funny as he made it seem.As I become more immersed, I realize that politics is just a tip of the SNL iceberg. It is the world in ninety minutes. I began regularly pausing every three minutes to voraciously cram culture trends, global affairs, and even celebrity gossip, so I could laugh along when Miley Cyrus announced that Hannah Montana was murdered. SNL showed me that New York is a place where everything matters, because everything belongs here, the epitome of globalization. However, New York City is just one reason why NYU is a paradise for media learners like me.My involvement with NYU begins at the Global Scholars Program at Steinhardt, where I am grappling with the variety of media practices amongst various countries and cultures. It is where I spend my first year, developing a foundation in media through courses in Global and Transcultural Communication, and Tisch, where I will have on-set opportunities to work with film and television production teams. The MCC study in NYU penetrates everything, endowing me with an overall grasp of media.The following spring, I am in Paris—and in broader extent, Europe—accessing courses in arts and culture in Europe, while taking advantage of traveling to neighboring countries, as I make better sense of the womb of the Renaissance. I learn what self-expression truly means, subjecting myself to the non-conforming spirit of Europe. Gradually, I am capable of finding not only my own voice, but also the genuine voices within others, helping them express themselvs, like Dante did in his astonishing grasp of societal struggles in Divine Comedy.My next destination is a temporary trip home to China. The rapid development of media in China means there are plenty of areas for improvement. Through the course in MCC and Interactive Technology and Media in NYU Shanghai, I familiarize myself with the Avant-guard media science being tested and applied. I make the most of my time by interning part-time at an advertising company near Huangpu River, where I am applying my knowledge to designs that will most effectively communicate ideas. The process realizes my accumulated knowledge, putting it into a concrete and persuasive form.When my exploration concludes in New York, I will be a global media apprentice, integrating my personal influences with visions from various parts of the world. Amongst my NYU fellows, I listen to their voices, and participate in media production to put culturally significant ideas on stage, further expanding the prospering diversity of NYU. And I am only getting started."

This cavern might be rather amusing to wander leisurely on a weekend, but I was alone and tired, as midnight approached.Dead-end. An old, shutdown exit.All my patience vanished as I stood there, letting anxiety and frustration accumulate in its place. Under the faint incandescent light, I stared hopelessly at the deathly ashen roadblock. Sweat formed in my grip. The limitation was suffocating.‘We are all limited. Know where your limit is, and never cross it.’ Somehow that moment, the remark from my TOEFL teacher crossed my mind.‘Another limit, huh?’ I scoffed. My youth seems bounded by limits.I recalled the endless dialogues before each “Club Day” performance. The age divide between teachers and students created equally divided opinions on artistic beauty. Conflicts rarely came singly and far outnumbered compromises. My role with Student Association Union placed me in the center of it all, giving rise to visions of harmony that hopelessly remained visions. I sighed, I cried, and I sulked, but in the end I realized my goals were far beyond my limits.I recalled the furious vetoes I put on the personal statement ideas I originally conceived. I wanted to create something touching, heart-stirring even, like the last scene in Silver Linings Playbook when Bradley Cooper makes the right decision; yet every attempt turned out pathetically phony. I became irritated, sensitive, and eventually admitted that the essay I dreamed of was beyond reach.Wrong direction again.Turning around, I noticed the commercial of a famous iced tea campaign with teenagers gathered singing and dancing. At the end, they all take a sip and shout: ‘YOUTH IS UNLIMITED!’ I found it rather misleading—of course youth is limited, like any other age brackets in life.The rejections from my crush set clear boundaries on who I could date. The barely-acceptable grades on my dedicated physics project demonstrated the extents of subjects I could master. The fatigue from my 15-minute morning run signaled my physical limits.Too many times I have approached unfamiliar matters bolstering with confidence, only to be overwhelmed, like a moth consumed by the beautiful flames it boldly embraced, unaware of its own trivial presence—it's fatal and no good.Sure, we all have dreams to realize, but in reality, we usually just aren’t quite there—limited. My teacher was right in that sense.I encountered the same crossroad I passed earlier. I took a deep breath, and took an obscure route.But after recounting all the incidents, so what? Actually, he was half right—we all indeed have limits, but ‘never cross it’? That seems unconscionable because that would be neglecting my gains in spite of failure, even if they don’t meet our expectations. If I had not tried my best the first time to settle the conflicts in SAU, I wouldn’t have done better the next time. If I never courted my teenage crush, I would have never discovered the subtle art of romance. Even Abraham Lincoln himself was known for his numerous failures that culminated into his inspiring leadership.I believe limits exist for all of us, but our ‘irrational’ boldness is what stretches these limits. Each time I defy my limits, I know them better, so I can push even harder next time as I edge towards becoming the person I want to be.The anxiety subsided, the shackles on patience were removed. ‘EXIT’, read the sign on the wall. I rushed it like a caveman discovering the light he had been searching for. Liberated.",
    "Supps": "题目：We are a community with quirks, both in language (we’ll welcome you to Grounds, not campus) and in traditions. Describe one of your quirks and why it is part of who you are.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Shenzhen is one of the few cities that strictly mandates student dress code—all the students in the city wear the same kind of uniform: blue polo for the boys, white polo for the girls, and dark trousers for all. The design itself is dull, exacerbated by the humdrum of monotony five days a week—like the Oompa-loompas in Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. Depressing.That is why I never wear my uniform properly, rolling up my trousers’ leg like a vagabond, soliciting penned artwork from my classmates to be immortalized on the white neckline, and inscribing “EXCELSIOR” on the back of the jacket to declare my pursuance towards excellence. My friends laugh and call me “quirky”, but I take it as a compliment.There is a reason for this quirkiness. Difference is what makes the world so bewilderingly beautiful. It is through distinctness that we begin to identify art, and allows us tell apart the intricate cultures of civilizations. What contributes to this difference is creativity, and those who adeptly utilize it. I might not become a great ruler in the future, but I can surely leave my legacy as an artistic non-conformist within my established community. I am not a troublemaker but a trend leader; I am the one whose quirkiness stands out among the flood of blue and white, that has gradually become my signature. “That’s Leo”, they say, pointing at the one with the inside-out school jacket.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What work of art, music, science, mathematics, or literature has surprised, unsettled, or challenged you, and in what way?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          If I tell the world that Saturday Night Live unsettles me, they will probably laugh; but this is the power of SNL—to make viewers laugh, and leave them unsettled.Living in China, I can only develop a narrow interest in politics. It was some serious subject that serious people talk about on serious TV channels like CCTV—certainly much too serious to have anything to do with me. Then one time, I found Seth Meyer in Weekend Update, making sarcastic commentary on the electorate that I did not get. But, the laughter from the audience was so contagious that it compelled me to Google related news and background information. It was a shock to me that the president was not chosen by majority vote, but through the complex electoral system. The ten-minute clip was far more effective than the countless evening CCTV I grew up with.Politics was just a tip of the gigantic SNL iceberg. I began to voraciously scour the Internet on culture trends, global affairs, and even celebrity gossip, so I could laugh along when Miley Cyrus announced that Hannah Montana was murdered. By the end of the day, why the U.S. government shut down itself may have nothing to do with me, but it is everything I am eager to learn about. ;Humor is an art with an incredible ability to incite curiosity and desire to understand things across cultures and borders—even things occurring on the insipid CCTV. SNL unsettles me, in turn expanding my desire for knowledge."

    "CommonApp": "Endless ripples of faces flow amid a deep-sea of blue and white, a typical sight of Friday rush hour. They are thousands of students in identical uniforms—strictly mandated and enforced since the early 90’s.But we are not like Oompa-loompas from Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory, subject to indistinguishable uniformity. Underneath the outwardly dismal monotony, there are ruses—trade secrets amongst artists craving for individuality like a desert rogue craving water. A pair of trousers is seen subtly rolled like those of workers in an old Ford factory, a decorated neckline etched with comic characters catches the eye, and inscribed on the back of my own jacket in bold ink, is my favorite slogan, “EXCELSIOR”, signifying my pursuance of excellence.Growing up in this non-conforming community, I inherited a strong desire to showcase my own uniqueness—to be a standout and innovative artist amongst my peers. In kindergarten I occupied the entire blackboard with my comic strip to retell (in colorful rendition) the story of the raven that brilliantly satisfied its thirst from a deep pitcher. Seventh grade was when I supplemented a boisterous Queen anthem to the end of a classic Chinese play, where soldiers were returning in triumph. The group project I directed garnered loud applauses from the classroom and judge teachers with its unconventional infectiousness. Each of these inspirations triggered a release of dopamine, and I became addicted.It was this same thrill boiling in my vein when I formed the idea behind Shenzhen School Uniform, a short film I co-directed in memory of the community I live in, by intertwining a selection of stories instead of following the traditional short-film formats with their singular plot line. With a belief that the best way to represent youth was through youth itself, we began gathering (and piecing) diverse stories from the students around us, to showcase the vibrant student culture we were all so proud of. At last, our project found unexpected audiences from all over the country, and earned us a short-film award, attesting to my commitment and beliefs.Shenzhen School Uniform is not only a depiction of the world I come from, but also a reflection of my non-conforming ideals the world had instructed. I am told that being outside the box itself is a work of art, a self-expression that I will keep on telling in forms other than a video, as I broaden my understanding of life in another country, another world.",
    "Supps": "题目：Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience that is important to you.

Darkness. 4 a.m. at Shenzhen Foreign Language School. By the faint snore of my roommates, I start my school day.High school at first bewildered me with various hands-on activities within the campus. I wanted to enhance my athletic skills on the tennis team, establish my own project to arrange student volunteer interpreters for the Shenzhen Museum, and be on time for every live broadcasting of daily news to the entire campus. Naturally, my passion outside the classroom affected my performance inside, and as a result, I failed my first exam in Shenzhen Foreign Language School.Instead of giving up the activities though, I decided I would wake up three hours earlier each day, at 4 a.m., to study. I would be caught dozing during Mr. Jiang’s music class and sometimes spoke in nonsense with my friends, but I was too determined to give up.It worked. On the first mid-term I ranked twenty out of nine hundred students while successfully leading my activities. Soon after, the praise began to fall. One teacher told my story to her class as demonstration of exemplary hard work; at a general assembly, I was asked to give a speech in front of the entire Senior One class about time management; “Early riser” became my nickname. ;Additionally, I was proud of being recognized by teachers and students on my way to lunch. I relished in their admiration, and how they considered me a “legend”. Even on days when I didn’t have to, I still woke up early in case I was asked, “When did you wake up today?”After some time when the praise diminished, I began hearing different opinions beneath the encouragements: “He is insane”, “He doesn’t have a life”, “I rank ahead of him even though I wake up at seven”. The voices of complete strangers affected me, and “Riser-at-four” had become my unwanted label, a mark of my incompetence that I was eager to shed.I decided to “quit” rising early, despite being unsure of how it would affect the balance I took so long to establish.My volunteer program was cut by the end of the semester because I failed to send capable student volunteers to the museum, and I messed up my responsibilities as an organizer for a large performance due to the negligence of a key procedure in backstage. Sitting in the classroom alone after school, I realized I let a “label” get to me too easily. I let opinions of strangers impact the decisions I made.To wake up at four was a choice I made for myself, along with my decision to pursue media, or to prefer Coke over Pepsi. They should be neither a source of pride nor shame, for they simply shape who I am.One thing is for sure—there will always be judgments alongside our choices, but the independent soul takes neither support nor criticism too seriously. Praise should not form into pride, just as criticisms should not carve cowardliness. The next day I woke up at four again. I opened my eyes amid the darkness, on my way back to action."

    "CommonApp": "If insanity is as Albert Einstein defined it, “doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result,” then I’m insane, or at least I was for the longest time. I participate in hackathons, daylong programming hubs where people of similar passions can come together to create original applications in hardware or software. At every event, my inventiveness and mental faculties are delightfully challenged. With only twenty-four hours to turn my ideas into something tangible, I often find it difficult to complete my projects. Yet despite failing to finish multiple times, I continue to return because these events are more than mere outlets for my creative expression.It started two years ago at a hackNY hackathon—a gathering of undergraduate developers, designers, and entrepreneurs. After I was advised to \"build something you need,\" I remembered being home alone and having to scour the Internet for food recipes, only to find listed ingredients that I didn’t have. So I created QuickBite—an app I needed—which could search a database using one’s available ingredients and return feasible recipes. Twenty­four hours passed, but I was unable to finish or present my work. An air of defeat surrounded me that day, but not without an overwhelming sense of inspiration invoked by my love for creating.Four hackathons passed in kind. Each time, I drew from my needs and experiences to form my applications: ForeSpeak, to help me learn foreign languages; Gamelify, to keep track of my online games; SportTrack, to log my sports networks; and Moov, to let me more easily invite friends to watch movies. But I could never finish within the twenty-four hours given. Every time, I learned from my mistakes; I’d build on the knowledge and foundation of my previous works. But the time constraint would continually defeat me.Within months of the last, I registered for another hackathon, Hack the Change, at the University of Pennsylvania. This one was different; it focused on assisting the international community and creating the change we wished to see in the world. Having read of the failing pharmaceutical system in Botswana, I designed a mobile app that could help the nation's people locate the medicine they need. Throughout the night my fingers danced until the twenty-fifth hour rang, the hacking ended, and I had finished. In cheery disbelief, I tested my application over and over again, and it worked every time.Moments later, students funneled into a lounge, eager to reveal the products of their restless labor. Having never completed in time before, I watched intently as each group presented, until I was called up. On stage, I paused and looked around. I wanted to be here; I chose to keep coming back; I realized that using items that could fit in a backpack, anyone—myself included—could make an impact on the world. I took a deep breath, andbegan, “Every day, thousands of people in Botswana are forced to live with untreated, life­ threatening medical conditions because they can’t find the pharmaceuticals they need...” I had finally been able to finish one of my projects—and I knew why.Every app I had built before, was built for me. I conceived them from my experiences and tailored them to my needs. But this time was different. This time I was building to improve the lives of people I didn’t know. Taking into consideration the needs of others, even those of strangers, entailed a sense of purpose that motivated, that compelled me to finish. I realized that every application I had created—recipe finder, sports tracker, or movie inviter—could touch the lives of many, and that I’m never only building for myself. Am I insane? Others might think so; after all, I willingly stay up for twenty-four hours. But I don't believe I am, because hackathons don’t just offer me an outlet to express myself, they give me purpose—building for that impact I can have on others.",

(250 word limit.)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Whenever I love what I do, there’s nothing that can stop me from doing it. After watching the main character of C huck hack and code his way out of impossible scenarios, I was inspired to become a programmer. I watched YouTube tutorials on coding and I fell in love with what I now consider, an art. Everything I’ve learned as a budding programmer stems from informal origins—the books in my room and the lectures saved on my computer.Entering high school, I was disappointed to find that my school didn’t offer any computer science courses, but I continued to code anyway. Throughout the year, I had to juggle my schoolwork with my programming projects, which always kept me occupied. Towards the end of tenth grade, I decided to take the AP Computer Science A exam after working through Stanford’s SEE course in Programming Methodology—and I’d like to thank Mehran Sahami for being the greatest teacher I never knew.Computer science has taught me to think differently; it has given me the ability to bring my ideas to life and to budget my time. I’ve been able to expand my creative horizons and put my knowledge to use at hackathons—often for the benefit of others. Despite never taking a formal course in computer science, I’ve been able to learn and grow more than I could’ve ever imagined. I’ve realized that I should never wait for the proper guidance to present itself, because I can always seek out the resources I need.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate ­­ and us ­­ know you better. (250 word limit.)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Greetings, fellow ProFro!First off, I’m always happy and energetic—you’ll most likely realize this upon first sight. I’m never a stranger and always an adventurer. I hope you’ll join me in trying new foods (if it smells bad, it could be delicious), exploring places (the city via Caltrain) and debating whether Batman or Ironman would win in a fight (heads up, I’m a proponent of Ironman). Being optimistic, I’m always here to cheer you up with nerdy humor should you find yourself down—forgive me if I sound like the Big Bang Theory at times.If you ever see me jumping around campus like a spider monkey, don’t be alarmed, I’m not possessed; it’s a passion of mine called freerunning. You’ll likely see me engaging in this seemingly deranged behavior if I have to get somewhere—fast. Despite being active, I love to sleep which, coming from New York, might surprise you. But wake­ups won’t be an issue as I’m a morning runner and hope that you’ll join me. If running isn't your thing, I’d love to grab a cup at the CoHo.I love learning—humanities, cultures, sciences, people—so you’ll often find me in the Green Library; not only during Dead Week. You’ll also see me typing away at my computer at times but feel free to interrupt me; I’m serious. I’ll most likely be working on some app I thought of in the shower and would love to tell you all about it. I can’t wait to meet my lifelong friend.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What matters to you, and why? (250 word limit.)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Should you focus more on the problem, or the solution? Though many would pick the solution—undoubtedly believing it would solve the former—I prefer to concentrate on the problem. I’ve learned from programming that it’s more important to know why you’re building, than to know what you’re building. Looking at a problem from different perspectives gives me a better understanding of what I’m trying to solve. Only then, can I find the best solution.At Facebook’s NY hackathon, I worked on a mobile app that could let me more easily bring my friends together to watch movies—no more mass texting. But that night, I lost track of the problem at hand and was unable to finish. I added non­essential features like a movie rating system even though the primary focus was on inviting friends via Facebook. Ever since, I’ve adopted a problem­ oriented focus so I can always keep in mind the true problem.The concepts I’ve learned from programming aren’t just applied to my work—they’re applied to the way I deal with personal issues. During sophomore year, I wasn’t performing as well I should’ve been; tests became difficult and homework grew demanding. The immediate thought that came to mind was to work harder. But after examining the problem—and realizing that a cycle of sleep deprivation and inattentiveness was the true cause—I arrived at a very different solution: to relax more. Never again, did I have the same issue. For me, fully understanding the problems is more important than finding the solutions."

    "CommonApp": "On most nights, the stars to me look like fluffy bunnies, and the moon like a giant marshmallow. My astigmatism isn't debilitating--I think I look classy in glasses. In fact, my problematic vision is probably one reason I'm interested in how machines and people can work together to help us see the world.I've been fascinated with computer vision since 9th grade, when I developed software to recognize traffic lights and warn distracted drivers. The following year, I created an algorithm that recognized a walking person and generated useful gait data for doctors. While scouring scientific journals that same year, I discovered that doctors were trying to marry computer analysis with human intuition to see into human tissue biopsies to diagnose cancer. At least, that was the idea.Reality was a bit different. Pathologists reading biopsy slides must deal with billions of pixels of raw data. Interpretation isn't black and white: what one pathologist sees as a 3+4 Grade cancer, another may regard as a 4+3 Grade cancer. Those diagnoses are vastly different, so precision and objectivity are vital. So is speed; pathology labs must rifle through thousands of slides. Computers are good at these tasks, but they are not so great at others--recognizing faces, for instance. It's surprisingly difficult to write algorithms for most of the things humans do without thinking.What if I trained an algorithm to quickly differentiate between these two prostate cancers--to think like a person distinguishing the face of a friend from a stranger? I needed lots of slide images to start working, but even after 40+ pleading emails to professors, I mostly got silence. I eventually found a supportive researcher named Dr. Veltri who shared the data I needed.Computers don't spend their free time in art museums. I needed to \"teach\" a computer to see tissue objects and encode them into compact numerical descriptors that a computer could understand. Like teaching Art Appreciation to someone who doesn't like art, I had to teach patterns and similarities, rather than meaning. Ultimately, I designed a feature extraction algorithm, Procist, to identify crucial elements: how textured and colored is the tissue? What is the spatial relationship and frequency of nuclei, glands, and stroma?Now I simply needed to find an AI algorithm to recognize patterns in Procist data. Digging into literature, I discovered that most studies recycled the same tired algorithms. Why not create my own?I agonized over this problem for weeks until my amateur culinary passion somehow inspired me. Spreading the final layer of mascarpone over a tray of espresso-soaked ladyfingers, I scribbled a few sudden thoughts on a kitchen towel. My AI would have a layered, tiramisu-style architecture! I called it SMLSVM, each layer converting digits into progressively abstract concepts until the data trickled to the bottom, where a final diagnosis would be made.I slowly trained SMLSVM on Procist data, and it began to \"see\" the patterns that differentiated prostate cancers. After advancing to Intel ISEF, I won 2nd Grand Award and a trip to tour CERN and exchange insight with brilliant researchers. A medical informatics company at Johns Hopkins heard about my work--I am now the Chief Innovation Hacker of Proscia Inc., a cancer diagnosis software company.I like teaching computers to see things our eyes can't, but working with my fellow students is even more rewarding. I currently mentor students through the adventure of science fair. At each workshop, we explore experimental design and brainstorm topics aligned with the students' passions. I also coordinate an international science magazine, one where dancers leap into the physiology of ballet and gamers charge into the psychology of Starcraft.Although science fairs happen only once or twice a year, I am determined bring this forum for creativity and problem solving to everyone, all year round. Everyone's talents and questions can add to human knowledge--that's something I can see, even without my glasses.",
    "Supps": "题目：Stanford students possess an intellectual vitality.

Look around--Google's self-driving cars will remove human error from the road. We can automate so many tasks with such speed and precision that someday, humans might be out of the picture.I thought this too. Proscia believed that we could revolutionize cancer diagnosis by building a digital pathologist. Computers were clearly faster and more analytical than human pathologists.But as I interviewed pathologists to determine what we could mimic through software, many of them insisted that diagnosis was not only science, but also art. It required compassion, interpretation, and an all-too-human intuition: things computers obviously lacked.This challenged me, so I dug deeper. I knew that computers were amazing calculators and data analysts--jobs humans aren't good at. However, humans can understand abstract concepts and ultimately, create. Machines can free us from mundane computation, leaving us more time and brainpower to unleash our creative faculties. Computers won't replace humanity; they can only enhance it.Our entire focus shifted. What could we do to bridge the two worlds? I understood that computers could process and display tons of data. But human insight, directed towards a chart, could discern unexpected relationships that a computer could not. So I designed a novel data visualization tool for prostate cancer biometrics, allowing doctors to explore data that had been preprocessed by a computer.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus.

Whatever the cost, I will find a way to stick a fridge in our room. I'm sure it'll also serve as an excellent closet.Experiencing different kinds of food feels like cave spelunking - sometimes, only intuition can guide you. Food defies language - no matter what culture you're from, we unite through just five basic flavors. You might need art history to understand Rothko, a music education to appreciate Penderecki, or a ballet background to comprehend Nijinsky. But anyone can delight in pierogi without knowing that it's Polish, or enjoy tajine without knowing that it's Morrocan.I'm a computer science and medicine geek, so I originally believed that cooking appealed to my right brain. But I've since realized that cooking and science are really the same thing. Cooking a great meal involves so many factors, processes, and techniques that a kitchen feels like a laboratory where odors should be sniffed, where chemicals should be tasted, where the fruits of your research are sometimes literally fruit, slowly poached in wine, spices, and herbs for a delicious compote.Ultimately, food satisfies hunger. But what food has taught me about science is that quality, passion, and diligence can create experiences beyond simply being full or answering our questions. And like research, great cuisine is so much more fulfilling when it's for a cause beyond ourselves.I pray that you have no dietary restrictions. We will absolutely shatter the freshman 15, together.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What matters to you, and why?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I remember the fusion of cultures, languages, histories--a noisy communion that pervaded the elementary and middle school music room. But music became more of a solitary affair as I got older. In high school, everyone vanished into practice rooms, isolating themselves from the duets of years before. It seemed as if each musician in the orchestra were a soloist, and everyone else was simply a future competitor in a sonata competition.I understood that musicians had to develop their individual skills as they progressed. But couldn't they share along the way? Isn't that what music really is: sharing? Through my violin, I spun stories without words, and shared my emotions for any moment in time.My friends also understood that music was about sharing, so we founded the Students' Association for Young Artists, an environment where any student could discover music through free private group lessons from our fellow high school musicians. Although few musicians were willing to sacrifice their time in the beginning, the few who discovered how fulfilling teaching was told others. Eventually, we had so many mentors and students that only the maximum occupancy of the library limited us. Through us, over 70 students have explored the proper bow hold, the rich timbres on a saxophone, and the arduous, but exhilarating process of learning fingerpicking on a guitar.Today we coordinate two branches, and are continuing to grow. For us, music is no longer a solitary affair."

    "CommonApp": "The dressing room is a blur of shimmering fabric, partially clothed bodies, and mountains of make-up and bobby pins. I survey the landscape in dismay. Five minutes to my next scene and I still haven’t changed costumes. The phrase “break a leg”, frequently used to express good luck in live theater, takes a literal meaning as I struggle to simultaneously pull on an overstuffed dress and run to the stage. The curtain lifts, the spotlights flash, and I am transformed into a character from a faraway world.In eighth grade, I decided to audition for the Tri-District Arts Consortium (TriDAC), a three-week summer program in various areas of fine art. I was wavering between keyboarding and chorus when my friend suggested, as a joke, “Why not drama? Don’t be boring.” I laughed it off, but the idea of a performing in a live play, complete with flashy costumes and over- exaggerated facial expressions, began eroding my previous determinations. I decide to take the plunge.From the moment I step foot in the TriDAC auditorium to the last day of camp, every hour is a frenzy of energy and activity. The theater students are intimidatingly loud, wild, and flamboyantly outgoing—as a typically shy and quiet girl, I am completely and totally overwhelmed. I dread the day a counselor will circle by me during vocal warm-ups, yelling “RED LEATHER YELLOW LEATHER” in my face until I yell back with the same gusto. I dread the day I will miss a step during choreography and fall on my face. Most of all, I dread the day everyone will realize what I already suspect: I have made a terrible mistake in stepping so far outside my comfort zone.My only solace is knowing I am guaranteed a role in the final production, a musical version of “The Ugly Duckling” in which all characters are talking farm animals. I silently resign myself to a simple chorus role as the cast list is called.“Annie Hu...LowButt!” Shock. Then joy. Then panic.This was no chorus role; this was my own scene and solo as a unique and aptly named hen. This was a chance to prove myself, but also a chance to fail spectacularly in front of hundreds of strangers. I spend the next week immersing myself in the character, her feelings and motivations, her actions and appearance. Speaking in a British accent? Daunting, but not impossible. Waddling and squawking like a chicken? Uncomfortable and embarrassing, but not terrible. Wearing a fat-suit? Hilariously excellent. It happens so gradually I don’t even notice: I become comfortable with all the activities I dreaded at the beginning of camp, laughing and stomping my way through the warm-ups and dance routines, joining the “loud and wild” theater kids in musical numbers during lunch, and transforming into a farm animal with reckless abandon.All too soon, opening night arrives. We rush to the dark stage wings, listening to chatter from the audience and to our own frantic beating hearts. We run through frantic scene and costume changes, learning to adapt with broken microphones and forgotten lines. We dance and sing and act until our energy runs out, but we find the strength to keep going.I have been performing in live theater for years since that first performance at Tri-DAC, and the nerves and exhilaration of the first opening night never go away. Theater has taught me how to be fearless, how to be creative, how to throw myself fully into a pursuit without worrying what others will think. The pure essence of theater is letting go of inhibitions to reach an inner power, an inner determination to be anyone and anything I want, both onstage and offstage. To me, that is true strength.",

Joining MathCounts in sixth grade showed me how complex math could be and how little I knew. This complexity, however, only made math so much more interesting. I spent hours devouring problem solving books, always wanting more.When I first heard the term “AwesomeMath”, I laughed. While the name sounds silly, however, the camp was not. The classes were challenging, daily 3 hour lectures in two fields of mathematics, taught by brilliant mathematicians (one was a former IMO coach). We students shared a love of problem solving that diffused through every conversation, every word, every breath we exchanged. Surrounded by such talent and passion, I improved more than I ever thought possible.Beyond concepts, AwesomeMath taught me how to think, how to work, and how to live. I learned to spend days puzzling through problems, losing myself in the complexities of p-adic numbers or homography groups. I learned to collaborate effectively, bouncing ideas and strategies around like molecules until the perfect collision illuminated the path to a solution. I learned to broaden my perspective of the world around me, discovering applications of math in fields ranging from genetics to artificial intelligence.Three weeks passed in the blink of an eye, and an intangible sense of solidarity pervaded the entire camp, formed through hours of late night problem sets and discussions with thinkers who thirsted for knowledge and innovation. For the first time, at this “silly” camp, I felt truly at home.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus.

If you didn’t laugh, don’t worry, I have plenty more).Besides my appreciation of cheesy math puns, I have some other habits you should prepare for. I shudder at crinkled paper. I watch Jeopardy every night, calculating my potential wins as a contestant. I always eat chicken wings with a fork – it’s classy. I constantly hum show tunes, and will probably attempt to force my love of musicals on you as well. I cry every time an onscreen character cries. I can – and will – quote the entirety of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Finding Nemo, and (of course), Mean Girls.I like to keep myself occupied. I might stay up all night to perfect the conclusion of a paper, to watch a meteor shower, or to compete in a massive camp-wide water fight. I might even climb buildings at 3:00 AM to de-stress from final paper writing. I dream of visiting Paris, of proving the Goldbach Conjecture, of discovering the secrets of making perfectly crisp yet tender calamari. I MacGyvered AP Physics labs at home because I had the freedom to, and why not? I spend a lot of time with my computer, whether puzzling through problems on Project Euler or reaching level 350 on Candy Crush Saga (which some call “no life” but I regard as a testament to my patience and dedication). I won’t, however, spend much time in the room – there’s too much to experience and never enough time.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What matters to you, and why?

I have roots in the Society of Thespians, who raised me to be bold and adventurous. I have strong ties to the Mathematics tribe, who helped me embrace the all-work-but-some-play culture of math team, and with whom I share fond memories of crazy bus rides, grueling competitions, and many, many games of Ultimate Frisbee. I was recently adopted by a Council of Women in Technology, who gave me invaluable advice on building skills and careers in computer science, and inspired me to help spread CS education in my state. Finally, just this summer, I became “Ms. Hu-Rickoid” after meeting 80 wonderfully talented, motivated, and friendly students at the Research Science Institute. Through living together, running around Boston together, crying over paper-writing together, and spending countless hours discussing anything and everything together, we truly became a family.Communities matter to me – they have each poured and mixed their unique cultures to shape the particular, individual blend that is my life. My “extended families” stimulate me, move me to aspire and achieve higher, and make me learn and grow. At Stanford, I have the freedom to join the communities I have grown to love, to explore many more, and through them to leave my own impact on the world around me."

Suddenly all movement stops, and a man steps out, stroking his fresh grown beard around his smiling lips.“Success!” All the scientists in the room hug and cheer.The next day, newspapers headline, “Another big stride for genome research. DNA no longer a mystery!” A bioinformatics expert is quoted: “We are excited to have engineered a way to decipher “disorderly” codes in DNA sequences, letting us pinpoint and successfully activate the genes of Kevin’s beard pores. Our next goal is to configure ‘Santa-beard’ in time for Christmas!”“Hey! You’re dreaming again!” my friend scolds.I disappointingly returned to reality, the AP computer science classroom.“Sorry.”My mind was clouded by the recent success of the “ENCODE” project deciphering DNA ‘junk-genes’ (genes containing no information on the synthesis of proteins and chemicals in our bodies), and a separate investigation on DNA using Zipf's Law (a mathematics law for assessing linguistic attributes) concluding that junk-gene codes observed the same laws and features governing computer programming languages. Could they be the same?Having studied both biology and computer science, I realized in many ways DNA is similar to software codes. From having fault-tolerance ability (software’s ability to run with minor bugs, like our organic bodies), to having a stable number based-system (AGCT 4-bit system), to possessing a fully operatic competence (the sensitive transcription of protein from DNA data), DNA works like a sophisticated operating system, possessing a database of knowledge we have not accessed.We take for granted the self-regulatory mechanism in our bodies, but do we truly understand why insulin automatically secretes when glucose is present? Instead, biologists call it a phenomenon, much like the ‘phenomenon’ of diseases before Pasteur’s discovery of microorganisms. Other questions, such as “Why do we age?” and “Why do cancer cells replicate?” may be answered within the enigmatic DNA sequences.Even so, understanding is just a beginning. I know it is naive but I do envision sometime in the future, we may code DNA like we code software. When I program Java, I feel a sense of humility, knowing that with the right set of keystrokes, this keyboard alone can revolutionize how the world connects. Meanwhile genome, an existing fabulous set of code, is a powerful language we barely understand.Sixty years ago, before high-level programming languages, people could not envision the world today connected through ideas and information on small devices. Likewise, in sixty years, possibilities are immeasurable once we unravel DNA to understand our bodies.Beard-growth is perhaps trivial, but what about a heart or liver? Perhaps we may program bone marrow and the immune system, so that no disease is left uncured. Then, my dream—genomicists saving lives—will no longer be a fantasy, but a vision.",

Reflect on an idea or experience that has been important to your intellectual development.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Having finished the PubMed reading assignments much faster than the graduate students, I bolstered with confidence when the professor asked me how.Feeling smug, I answered: \"Section by section? Like reading any textbook.\"Strangely, he didn't seem pleased. \"Listen, anyone can read, but we researchers analyze word by word. Did you scrutinize each sentence, and question every claim? Did you challenge the writing?\"That was the result of the naïve me stepping into laboratory for the first time at HuaZhong University, to conduct graduate-level research on systems biology. I was very involved, painstakingly sorting Caenorhabditis elegans with eyebrow strands, producing M9 buffer, and documenting conclusions, just like other researchers. Still to my annoyance, my professor and graduate friends never referred to me as a fellow researcher, but as 'the student'.\"Word by word\"\"Challenge the writing\" These words reminded me of demanding skeptics who are always too critical of other's effort. Furthermore, questioning every claim seemed like so much work.However, the professor made me rethink, realizing incredulity is the challenge and role of a scholar. It is the spirit of skepticism that distinguishes scholars from students: that many great leaps in science originated from doubt, even at the price of ridicule and contempt.Darwin asserted the theory of evolution to challenge the then widespread belief of Creationism. There is also Oswald Avery, who discovered DNA, disproving the prevalent belief that it was cell protein that contained genetic information. The history of science is a record of skepticism, of challenging ideas and proposing new rationales. Skepticism is what ensures science never remains stagnant.As a student, I lived a guided life with eyes and ears open, but never once guided myself with open voice and mind. Now moving on, I know to be skeptical in face of ridicule, to question facts from multiple viewpoints, and to reserve my credulity.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus.

This College Edition roommate, like many other goods, is made in China. Main features include hogging space and ruining perfectly good lab experiments, but be sure to read this personal manual thoroughly to make the most of my capabilities.1. Do recognize my voice well, because my appearance is not reliable. It is commonly subject to self-experimentation, such as the time I shaved my eyebrows to test their growth speed. (If you are curious, it takes four months to return – four long months of ostracism.)2. Ping Pong feature is not included, but basketball (High School Edition) has been preprogrammed.3. I am often found testing Newton mechanics and conservation of momentum with sandbags (If the dorm allows). Therefore, please be wary of noise, and remain calm. Do not try to unplug me at this time.4. On the subject of noise, you may commonly find yourself waking up serenely to charming jazz melodies I play on the clarinet.You may also find yourself assaulting me for blaring staccatos I play in times of stress. Unfortunately, under threat I am programmed to respond with (5)5. Physical combat. I am highly adept at Taekwondo.(Hence sandbags)We Taekwondo trainers don't fight except in emergencies, but I cannot guarantee your safety when enraged.(LOL, I am kidding)6. I come attached with a curious nature and 3TB of memory space ready for the US culture update. This requires that he be fully acclimated soon, with in depth understanding of America football.Joking aside, you can see that my friends regard me as unique for a reason, but I assure you these are very close friends. I may be the silly chatterbox, but I am always there for friends in need. I'm not a strange, violence-prone, music fanatic bent on world dominance.(At least for now) I just look forward to meeting another stranger from another place, to share college experiences with.See you soon!\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What matters to you, and why?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          The pedestrians couldn't help stopping, forming a half-circle. I looked up, greeted by beige walls dotted with clusters of brilliant red flowers. The faint words \"Mozarts geburtshaus\" were vaguely distinguished on the wall.With three friends, we stood in the middle of Mozartplatz basking in the splendor of playing the clarinet in front of Mozart's former residence. This Mozart's A major Concerto was our best gift to Salzburg. When the concerto was done, not only did the crowd burst into enthusiastic applause with cries of \"Bravo\", but the statue of Mozart nearby seemed to smile approvingly.As a participant in the International Youth Art Festival 2012 in Pisek, Czech Republic, the last thing on my mind was to play in public. As members of one of the best student orchestras in China, our devotion to music must be respected by tuxedoes and gowns. Real music is something we gaze upwards to appreciate, within the enclosed concert hall that captures 'true essence' of music – not found disrespected along streets.However, Europe is the magical land of music. No matter in Prague, Frankfurt, or Vienna, and no matter on a bridge or in a pub, musicians are everywhere. It may be a man with his homemade percussion set consisting of two egg-beaters and a spatula, or a rogue band consisting of only trombones and trumpets. Perhaps because here is the birthplace of Mozart, or because of the dedicated musicians whose music seems unfettered by their surrounding, we were compelled to join.On the street, people of all backgrounds were brought together by our music, even without 'full-essence'. That was when I realized Mozart did not compose music to simply suit the acoustics of lavish concert halls, but to create brilliance that can be spread indiscriminately.In that spirit, we returned to China, stepping on the Metro with assembled clarinets in hand. No matter what people think, our intents are most clear: As long as we use our hearts to impart music, we impart true essence."

    "CommonApp": "My letter read, “Lisa, you’ve done so much just by being there for your family every day. That’s enough for you to kick your rockets back into action, blast off through the atmosphere, and explode into the universe of awesome. That’s where you belong, Lisa.” I’d never met Lisa.Lisa was my first letter, a September request by an online organization called More Love Letters (MLL). To souls in need of emotional support, MLL offers the handwritten efforts of a community of complete strangers. In taking up our charge, we receive a paragraph about our subject’s suffering–it could be cancer, the loss of a loved one, or just plain stress. So when I read Lisa’s paragraph, I felt an urge to connect with her, a college sophomore who loved Doctor Who and making terrible puns but struggled to stay positive after she’d lost her mother. In that hour I crafted, snipped, pasted, and glittered up my first response.As I cleaned up the aftermath of that letter, I noticed that I felt somehow different, like I’d set off a wave in one of the universe’s many strings. I was struck by how I’d just reveled in one of humanity’s most sophisticated emotions, empathy. Submerging in that awareness of self was so sublime an experience that I had no choice but to share it with others. Thus, I founded the [high school name] Campus Cursive Chapter (an extension of MLL) to give that same plunge into empathy to my classmates. The chapter blossomed; when students found our uplifting little notes hidden around campus and posted on Facebook, “That made my day,” I marveled at how small actions could make such huge ripples. When I got the student body to write nearly 500 notes, all filled with quips and genuine appreciation, to the faculty, I vowed to uncover all the latent love that I knew must lie hidden in every community. When a freshman came up to me and asked if she could write to more people, I knew that sharing this chance to explore empathy was truly magical.Now, 752 letters later, when looking back on the first, I realize my initial empathetic exploration gave me more than just fleeting happiness: I found real, lasting meaning. In trying to understand Lisa, I’d searched for a second self, ripping my focus away from my high school existence and two-parent household to envision life without a mother. In doing so, I felt so much more human because I’d expanded beyond my tiny consciousness into the alternative perspective of another.Paradoxically, forgetting myself granted me greater personal clarity. To tap into her feelings of loss, I’d had to sift through my own experiences for the truth on how to cope. I was propelled back to sophomore year, when I lost a classmate to suicide, and remembered how hard I had struggled to empathize with everyone else who was left behind, especially her best friend. Serendipitously, Lisa gave me the chance to reexamine how I understood death, how to mourn, and I finally found closure in both our losses. It’s funny how when we send love out into the universe, the universe sometimes sends self-knowledge back. I treasure this awareness outside myself and the moment, free of the trivialities of everyday life, full of the feeling of wonder. Today still, I write love letters because I long to be a cog in the great cosmic machine that produces proof that being human is a privileged experience.",

What makes itunconstitutional? What exactly is Sharia law? Should I be happy or sad? Having recently analyzed the state of religious freedom for American Sikhs, I was on the alert for ethnic intolerance and the marginalization of another religious “other.” Yet as a feminist who’s read her fair share of Khaled Hosseini, I was suspicious of Sharia law. Seeking further clarification through news articles and advocacy websites provided no insight, only the back-and-forth ricochet of easy opinion lacking deeper interrogation.Through a foray into Constitutional language at the Yale Young Global Scholars program this summer, however, I found clarity. Studying selected court cases involving marriage law, I discovered precedents deeming Sharia law neither more noteworthy nor less immune to scrutiny than other religious codes such as Jewish ketubah practices. Just as the First Amendment’s Free Exercise clause validated the Torah’s claim upon Jewish husbands to compensate their wives financially upon divorce, so Houida Odatalla’s mahr, or Islamic prenuptial stating the same, was affirmed. After clearing through the noise of prejudice, reaching that sound conclusion was refreshing. In legal discourse, I’d finally found a stable mechanism immune to fear and bigotry for establishing informed opinions. That mechanism also dispelled my own bigotry, demonstrating that Sharia law can at times protect women and therefore requires a far more nuanced reception than Oklahoma initially realized.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus.

When guacamole’s consistency implies that it could have emerged from certain bodily orifices, and shrimp has too many legs and tendons that snap all too easily, how will we ever participate in the ultimate bonding experience of shoveling in twice our normal daily caloric intake in the wee hours of the morning?Instead, I guess we could craft sonnets about The Fresh Prince and seductive breakfast items (“To His Coy Bagel”), or play Cards Against Humanity (imagine politically incorrect, obscene Apples to Apples). If you shun the risqué, you can elect for my Close Friend eccentric bonding tradition: rapid-fire, aggressive attempts to upstage each other’s witty insults as we cackle at non sequitur and forgive the banal tropes of popular TV shows. To balance the snark, we’ll store daily notes of shared happy memories in a jar. We’ll conquer the horror genre with our eyes covered and burst into impromptu dance-offs.And even if you erect closet shrines to seafood and once illegally smuggled guacamole across certain national borders, even if you founded your local Anti-Fresh Prince club, even if you love every single thing I hate and we have nothing in common, I know we’ll both look after each other. Our hearts lie where the home is, and if my home is with you, then I don’t care how different we are – I’ve never had a problem making friendships meaningful.Nice to meet you, I’m Connie.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What matters to you, and why?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Senator Leticia Van de Putte asked, “Mr. President, at what point must a female senator raise her voice to be recognized over the male colleagues in the room?”––and all hell broke loose. Watching the livestream, I virtually roared with the gallery, triumphantly closing Texas Senator Wendy Davis’ 11 hour-filibuster against Senate Bill 5. Despite our ultimate defeat, it’s clear the real last frontier for humanity is not the West, space, or even AI. As evidenced by Wendy Davis’ filibuster, it lies in the recognition of female bodily integrity as the cultural norm.From Michigan’s legislation requiring preemptive insurance for pregnancy from rape to Texas SB5’s restriction of abortion access, women’s reproductive rights are increasingly under siege. How is it that since 1995, U.S. states have enacted 755 anti-choice measures, when most countries offer paid pregnancy leave and Bangladesh recognizes a third gender? Since oral drugs for terminating pregnancies have existed since the Middle Ages, I call anti-choice legislation even more medieval than medieval.Ultimately, I’m fighting to change a culture that demonizes and shames my female body, locks it under the shoddy justification of false morality and tradition, and declares it noble, good, and normal to wrest away my agency through legislation. But this is mine.This is my freedom. This is a place under my control alone, where neither ideology, politics, nor ignorance may enter. The right to choose matters to me because it means finally integrating women as free agents, with free bodies, into civil society."

    "CommonApp": "“I think you should leave him and move on.” I said with determination. My mother was shocked at first, but soon realized the reality. Most children dream about having a perfect family: loving and caring parents that would take them to the park every weekend and have family dinners every night. I, on the other hand, want the exact opposite: I want my parents to be divorced so they can move on with their lives. To say my parents were not crazy about each other would be an understatement. They were not supposed to get married in the first place. According to my grandmother, the only reason they got married was because the societal pressure they faced in their late 20’s. And soon after they got married, I was born. I remember clearly, at the age of ten, I was told by my father that “I was the only reason they remained married”. Back then, I was not sure what exactly it meant. To a certain extent, I was proud of playing the role of this special “bond” that tied them together. I reminded them about their anniversary and helped to come up with gifts for each other. I wrote heartfelt letters to comfort them every time they had big fights. I cried with my father and my mother every time it seemed that the damage was too severe to be repaired. Despite all the ups and down, even when they were in the middle of a big fight, the idea of a divorce never came up and they still looked at me with love and smiles. I thought of myself as the last and most crucial defense to their marriage and it was my obligation to guard it. Last year, my mother was diagnosed with breasts tumors and needed a big surgery to remove them. Although my father did his best to take care of my mom, I could see that she was never the priority for him and he would always choose his career over the woman he married. One day, when I was helping my mother to recover in the hospital, she talked to me about how scared she was since the diagnosis, and she was afraid of not seeing me again. She also told me how my dad and her had grown apart over the years and there was no love left in their marriage. I asked why she was telling me all these things and she said she realized I am now a grown up and I deserved to know the truth. It was then I realized: for a while, I was proud of the role of keeping this marriage together. I thought my conversations, letters, and efforts were the main reason that this family stayed together. I could not have been more wrong. The only reason they chose to not to have a divorce was because they saw me as a child who needed to be taken care of. I was not the bond that tied their marriage together. I was the handcuff that locked them in this unhappy relationship. The next morning, I told my mother that I wish they should divorce so they could move on. I realized that for so long, my childishness and selfishness had blinded me from notifying the sacrifices they had made and the tears they had behind every smile they gave to me. But as I am about to turn 18, I should stop worrying about my happiness, and instead theirs. Happiness takes all kinds of shapes and forms, and the sum of their happiness should always outweigh mine. Sure I will miss the Sunday family trips and the family dinners. But as long as I know my parents are  happier than they were, it’s the least I can do to repay them.",

Ralph always insists on keeping the civilization of human. He tries to keep fire on mountain as a signal, refuses to use spears for hunting, and persuades others to seek fruit. The regulations apply well at first until some kids become aggressive and lose their desire to be rescued. ;Nevertheless, when all the cruel and inhuman murders of Ralph’s friends take place during Jack’s usurpation, I finally realize Ralph’s intentions. At the beginning, despite the circumstances, Ralph possesses a clear mind that if the signal fire turns into a tool only for satisfying people’s appetite then people would lose their sense and manners. Ralph’s character in the novel represents the roles of sages and intellectuals in our society- leading and enlightening society through truth and justice.  ; ;Consequently, after reading the process of Ralph seeking civilization and merit, I realized the book is more than just a reflection of the frailty and darkness of people. Even if the world is easy to bow towards the weakness of humanity, there are still some people like Ralph. They would be confused and bewildered about the world, but they are still righteous and always striving for the good of human nature. In The Lord of the Flies, William Golding depicts a picture to warn us about greed, temptation, and to “know yourself” in positions of power and evil. This novel has made me think about my place in society and how I would act if I were in Ralph’s position of power.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：58% of Wake Forest's Class of 2015 received academic credit for faculty-directed research across academic disciplines.

I found that the reason why Rubber Duck was floating in Shanghai was because of a letter written by WABC, a public institution endeavored to help children with autism by teaching them to draw. I admired the mission of WABC for using creative ways to help children with autism. Inspired by WABC’s story, I created a collection of colorful plates made by children with autism.Thanks to this assignment, I found my passion in psychology and autism research.

As the leader of the LGBT organization in school, I encouraged Jane to let others know about her true self. To my surprise, she said no. She told me that if people knew about her sexuality, it would create a lot of problems for her friends and family. She worried that some of her friends would no longer talk to her. And, although she knew her parents would support her, she worried about the embarrassing comments that they would have to endure.

While touring the city our tour guide claimed that he had the right to decide where he wanted us to go. I later learned that this was common in Shangri-la because guides received kickback money from the places not listed on our itinerary. I tried to talk to our tour guide so we could travel to many spots as we planned. Not liking what I said, he threw our luggage out of the bus and left my grandma and I in the middle of nowhere. Outraged by his lack of professionalism, I wrote many letters to the local governing body to reflect what happened. Last year, new regulations were imposed to make tour guides more professional. Now tourist can focus on the beautiful scenery and culture of Shangri-la instead of worrying about being treated unfair by tour guides.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：How did you become interested in Wake Forest University and why are you applying?

He experienced the horrifying condition in which the master could plague slaves legally. However, he did not choose to use violence to overcome his problem. Instead, Douglass wrote three autobiographies to expose the life of slaves and became crucial spokesman during the movement of abolitionism. As one of the few men at the Seneca Falls Convention, he never wavered his support of women’s rights.As he wrote in the North Star, all humans are created equal, regardless of gender and race. While Harriet Tubman deserves to be on the ten-dollar bill for her contribution, Frederick Douglass deserves the “Hamilton” treatment for his contribution too."

I take care of them every day, study their habits, and allow some of them to reproduce. I've studied how chicks and silkworms hatch, grow and reproduce. I've seen my corn snake prey on mice twice its thickness, suffocate them, and swallow them. I trained my ferret, and found that she loves digging at night. I've experienced birth and death. Though it's not the same as observing their lives in nature, I have still been able to get a good understanding of their life cycles. My menagerie is my treasure, my 'living textbook' for animal behavior. Because of this, I know things my classmates do not know about animals, and I am proud of that.However, to build a menagerie at home was not easy. My mom is a sincere Buddhist, so she always thought of setting my animals free. My dad, who graduated from China's best university, happens to be afraid of snakes. Thus, I had to investigate the living environment to convince my mom that if I did set my animals free in the city, they would simply die out there; and I needed to promise my father that I would never let my snake crawl out of my room. ;Naturally I took proper responsibility for my animals, including feeding, caring, waking, training, cleaning and playing with them, making sure my parents hardly even noticed they were present. Sometimes, my work made me think of those Renaissance biologists who secretly conducted autopsies under pressure from religion.I have lived with my menagerie for more than five years. Through it, I continue to study and explore life in various forms, expanding my interest in biology outside the classroom. It has become part of me both in terms of my daily life and my study/career goals. Though it has sometimes been painstaking, I have never even thought of quitting. And I have no doubt that I will carry this persistence forward in my future life and scientific pursuits. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          My mother is a big believer in Bach Flower Remedies, which use plant extracts to balance emotional problems. I wondered how this was possible, and so I took a Bach course to study it. I learned about the 38 plants the products use, and how the founder, Dr. Edward Bach, wrote that some diseases are the result of conflict in the mind and can only be eradicated by mental efforts. Flowers, he said, could help people to smooth over these mental conflicts. ;The explanation sounds plausible, but from my IB chemistry classes and knowledge of biology I knew it was not. Herbal remedies certainly can have an impact, but Bach remedies are homeopathy. This has no scientific credibility. ;So why is it so popular? Thinking back over all that I had learned, I concluded it could only be explained from a psychological viewpoint. That is why I took a summer course - The Science of Psychology - at Columbia University. ;This was a great educational opportunity to study the human brain, drugs, emotions, personality, and related factors. Most importantly, I learned about placebos, and how the body can cure itself when the brain thinks it should be healthy, irrespective of provable medical efficacy of a treatment. This, surely, is how Bach Flower Remedies work. It can't be anything to do with liquid itself which (like all homeopathy) is simply mostly water. ;Because of this, I became interested in the scientific principles behind popular pseudo-science. A lot of people believe in pseudo-science and I wanted to explore why. This gave me the incentive to learn knowledge from many different fields to look for possible connections that might help me to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. ;Similarly, if we want our scientific studies to have practical impact, we must also consider ordinary people's acceptance, ethics, politics, and even economic situation. This is why I do not intend to restrict myself within my favorite subject, biology, but rather continue to be open-minded and develop a multidisciplinary approach. That is my goal for study at the University of California. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe your favorite academic subject and explain how it has influenced you.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Since my parents both work in the biomedical industry, I learned human and animal physiology when I was quite young. My mother wanted me to grow up not only with an understanding of the human body, but also with respect for animal life. My father told me that organs could potentially be created via stem cells, and used for life-saving transplants. From that time on, the natural sciences have fascinated me. ;In high school, I chose higher-level IB biology courses. To further explore my interest in the life sciences, I interned at the Shanghai Tissue Engineering Key Laboratory, attending Prof. Liu Wei's project as a research assistant. We cultured cells to investigate the effect of keloid fibroblasts' morphology on their phenotypes, and did surgeries on rabbits to replace sections of leg tendons with new materials to explore their efficacy. I studied PCR and gene expression. Learning how science can make changes in living organisms to improve people's living standards was wonderful.Besides cell culture and PCR, I also learned to anesthetize mice and do dissections. I was reluctant at the beginning since I love animals. However, since it was necessary to unravel the mysteries of certain cancers and diseases, and find cures, I overcame my fears and did it. ;I want to continue my investigation on keloid fibroblasts since keloid scars are currently incurable. Many people suffer from this, including one of my friends. If we can change the keloid fibroblasts' gene expression and convert them into normal fibroblasts, then this problem will be eliminated. ;From my studies, I also see that political power, laws, ethics and social morality sometimes restrict biological research. I made a presentation on the topic in my Theory of Knowledge class. I discussed how new medical technologies had often aroused fear - for example, when Robert Edwards pioneered in vitro fertilization he faced hostility and public abuse for 'playing God.' Yet today most people regard this as an unremarkable medical procedure. ;Thus, as well as pursuing biology, I also hope to use multidisciplinary studies to maximize the positive social impact of the biological sciences.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Art and culture have always mattered to me. In my junior year, I became leader of the Paper Art Club, which focuses on traditional paper arts, including Chinese traditional paper-cuts and origami. Paper art has a long heritage in China, but is not popular these days - that's why there were only three members when I took over the club.Traditional art illustrates the history and spirit of a nation, and that helps make us who we are. In recent years the younger generation in China has been able to look far beyond the country - but has neglected the treasures nearby. I decided to try to reenergize the club to protect my beloved paper art and generate greater interest in it.A poster campaign and exhibition of my works drew six new members. None had experience in paper arts, but were attracted by my creations. That was exciting news for me, but also a little worrying since making fancy origami cannot be done without basic skills. That meant I had to make plans to teach new members the basics of origami and paper cutting, as well as to introduce the history of Chinese traditional origami. To ensure each member enjoyed the process, I organized team discussions once a month, so that we could share the interesting works we had made or seen, and solve each other's problems together. ;When we were making a 3-meter long Chinese dragon for an exhibition, I spent much time on embellishing it because club members were still new to paper arts, but I was appreciative to see that everyone was fully dedicated to the work, aiming to surprise the school with this traditional art. When we opened our exhibition, the vivid, supple dragon delighted the school's teachers and students. They also loved our hand-made bookmark bazaar. And from that time, the club has been well known in school, with more students joining us to learn about this art.Contribution to a community does not always consist of bringing in something new; it can also lie in our insight and dedication to preserving something old. ;"

    "CommonApp": "My Addiction to ReasoningSeeing Faraday’s Plate Generator in the introduction part of the textbook in physics class, I spontaneously sank into calculation and analysis to deduce the Magnetic Flux formula written under the picture using Lorentz Force, the micro formula to describe electron. My brain was  automatically trying to find the unification between two explanations, because unify is reasonable in physics.People always find me staring at something(may be one's face, sunset glow, equation, or a maxim), and actually I am submerged in unconscious analysis to make every object or phenomenon reasonable, and to make its explanations from different dimensions be consistent with each other. This tendency accompanies and shapes my growth. Before my learning of any laws of science, anything would likely catalyze this kind of unconscious analysis. Perhaps my first memory of this was when, in kindergarten, I disassembled a clockwork spring frog and found its jump related to spring’s returning. This relationship was what gratifyingly “makes sense” for little me and what latter helped me to easily understand that the returning was a conversion of energy, a more mature \"make sense”. As I grow, thorough understanding and explanation of what I encounter also melt into my addiction for reasoning. For example, on a plane, even tiny squares in a particularly eye-catching mode on the carpet drew my attention, and lured me to figure out the pattern underlying their positioning. I identified a larger square composed of several squares, eager to find out the ratio of the horizontal intervals to the verticals. I distinguished lines in six directions to find out the deviation of each row. Finally, though this behavior doesn’t have any practical meaning, I “perceived” the data related to their positions, because of my addiction.Later when the plane suddenly sped up, the intense unease sensation catapulted my desire to explain it. Initially, using plane as my reference point I thought it was feeling of acceleration like gravity— everything falls backwards. However I immediately realized that if I’m right, I should feel the same when I am lying upward, but this sensation obviously was stronger when its acceleration was much slower  than gravity. It’s paradoxical. Finally, I concluded that this paradox stemmed from the fact that the force was unevenly exerted by the seat only on my body part near the seat, thus creating instant different acceleration in different parts of my body, also exacerbated by elevated blood pressure, while acceleration from gravity is equal for every part. I cherished my addiction and the plane took off.As exemplified above, my addiction to reasoning shaped me and encouraged me to utilize my knowledge to practice my logical thinking ability.Not long ago, the book Animal Farm unsettled “unbelieving” me, making me concern about how ignorant the public is, and fear that maybe there is something wrong in current seemingly satisfying political system leading to the distortion of humanity, but as a member of it ,I, like characters in the book, just cannot realize these distortions. Fortunately, my “logical” analysis soothed my concerns. One feature differentiating current political form from former governing frameworks is that the current one originated with scholars in France who were not themselves in power, who were able to, as bystanders, create a system not largely affected by their interests. In most fictional dystopias, the central factor leading to distortions of humanity and society is the rulers' addiction to power. The prevailing tripartite political system and congressional representation were designed to avoid this concentration of power. This addiction turns unbelieving me into skeptical me. Now I’m at doorway to university,retrospecting the growth of my addiction. I confirm that it is time for the 18-year accumulated ability to thinking show its value.This time, my analysis will help in thorough learning knowledges and put knowledges further in university’s researches when looking for unification.",

I believe it’s time to make some changes.  ; ;Subsequently, I did a research in Dali Addiction Centre. I have learned that drug treatment and cracking drug trafficking are too specialized and the most practical action is to warn people with potentially high risk of drug use to get away from risky conditions. To figure out what risky conditions are, I surveyed 100 addicts.Currently, my friends have promised to avoid  ;risky conditions and I have organized publicity to disseminate risky conditions."

    "CommonApp": "It may seem odd, but where I was born was the very single thing that I considered the greatest challenge of my life. To me, my homeland Hohhot was like a cage with nothing but confinement. Having to take the advanced English courses in the capital, I found myself trapped along with other students here who also craved for more access to knowledge and opportunity in an invisible yet invincible way. Besides, Hohhot was too ethnic. Being constantly asked if I rode a horse as transportation, I felt a bit funny but a lot disappointed and embarrassed, because I wanted my hometown to be remembered for skyscrapers, flashing lights, and other items commonly connected with modernization. \"I am never going to catch up with kids growing up in big cities,\" I thought hopelessly every night before I went to sleep.This aversion against my doomed fate haunted me for a long time. The more intense my aversion was, the harder I worked, both in academics and extracurricular activities, so that I could get rid of the confinement. Until one day, due to my excellent school performance, I was elected to be the school representative to attend Model United Nations Conference where I represented the senator of Michigan to discuss equal right and opportunity for women. I conveyed my idea that the government should play a leading role in employing female staffs more fairly and set stricter regulations to diminish the impact of discrimination and glass ceiling in work place to establish a women-friendly society. More over, I was the first one to discuss gender stereotype in the conference and successfully inspired the audience including both female and male students to think more on the bias by introducing provoking work stories of Sheryl Sandberg in her book LEAN IN.   To my amazement, I won an award at last due to my in-depth thought about this topic and sincere speech. Ecstasy filled my entire body not only because I attained one more achievement but also because I learned a profound life lesson from it. I began to understand that though there was disparity between educational environments, it was definitely possible to diminish or even eliminate the gap with personal efforts. Furthermore, I began to accept the fact that only a small amount of people are nourished under the best condition, but there are also numerous outstanding people rising from the rest. So if I keep working hard in the way I did with MUN, I can make my achievement as well. With this insight, I began to view my hometown with a new perspective. I started to question if I was too narrow minded asserting modernization to be the only value of a city. Hohhot has its own charm coming from the Mongolian history and culture , which attracts thousands of tourists to visit per year. I have no excuse to resent this city, a place where I am born and raised ,but all the reasons in the world to appreciate and love it.“Do you ride a horse as transportation?”  The next time I am asked by this question, I am going to reply that the alpaca is more in fashion.",

As a university named after its city, NYU comes with the glamour of New York city. Three years ago ,when I first visited the city, I immediately fell in love with it. Walking in downtown, I excitedly observed everything around and captured a view exclusive to NYC: The yellow cab on my left was rushing on the street to take its passenger to a destination; A booth on my right was selling hotdogs and burittos just around the corner of an ordinary building with the rusted iron stairs hanging outside. Some young people of different racial types were walking out of the building talking and laughing. Noticing that I was attracted to the group, the guide told me that the building was a property of NYU, a unique school that did not have a campus. “The city itself is the campus of NYU,”the guide said. At that moment, as a person from another background and city, I perceived the open spirit and felt embraced as if the city was my other motherland and the school was a place I was destined to go.After the trip to visit New York was over, NYU became a beacon in my heart illuminating the path to my future and also the fire igniting my will to work hard. After long and careful consideration, I decided to apply for College of Art and Science and major of Economics and Mathematics, because I believe it is an interdisciplinary subject that prepares scholars best for the future. When I interned in Standard Chartered Bank in 2015, I found it very interesting to analyze economic phenomenon with mathematic knowledge. Besides, I have been actively participating in business simulation contests through which my logical thinking ability was greatly strengthened. With my intense interest in economics and strong ability in mathematics, I am confident to become a successful professional in Economics and Mathematics after the systematic learning in NYU.To me, NYU is extremely tempting because of its excellent location, comprehensive spirit and diversified courses , and it is the only university I secretly wish to marry if it were a person. Finally, I am so sorry there is no room for a love letter to NYU."

    "CommonApp": "Body-shaking, the Philosophy of LifeStanding by the dance floor, I started to regret coming. I felt awkward staring at people shaking their bodies as if no one was watching. Hello, I was watching, and you just stepped on your date twice.I didn’t want to attend the Winter Formal originally; my friends made me. “Oh my god, you have to come to the Winter Formal, even if you go solo. It’s part of your American experience.” What a smooth trick; they knew exactly how to get me. I’ll have to admit, this type of dancing isn’t normally my thing. It lacks…a purpose. After all, what’s the purpose of people cramming in the gym, jumping all over the place, and having to shout to even say hello. Just as that clumsy dancer saw my disappointed look, my very enthusiastic friends came to my rescue. “Come dance, Robbie! Put your hands up, and shake it, shake it.” Okay…I would raise my arms and, with minimal confidence, shake my body. I was confused. Against the booming music, I asked, “hey, what’s the purpose of all this?” “Purpose? There’s no purpose. Dance is just dance.” I stopped my horrendous body-shaking; those words struck me.For eighteen years, whatever I do, I always know why I am doing it. I waved goodbye to my parents and boarded the plane for the United States, because I knew a year abroad would add richness to my life. I commuted on Metro Line 11 four hours every day during summer because I found my internship profoundly important to the world. I came to this dance anyway, because it had a purpose – I had a possibility to explore. I seek for purpose because there’s a relentless urge for me to go somewhere and do something, to find the path that connects present to future. I relish such a path because it gives order to life. There is mesmerizing speediness, certainty, and focus to it. Life is incredibly random and subtle, so one has to observe, think, and plan carefully to seize whatever means available to achieve the ends.And yet my friend, who was now busy “raising the roof” with the biggest smile on his face, said there are no such ends to chase after. Dance is dance; life is life; a rose is a rose is a rose.To the deafening beats, I seriously considered his words. Could it be possible that I had been attaching too many personal interpretations to life? Had I been so absorbed in amorphous concepts concerning means and ends that I had neglected what was right before my eyes? Had I been missing out on life, while constantly chasing after it?I looked around; clearly, for the past three minutes I had been missing out. I searched for my friend and saw him doing the robot move. Far from being a pro, but it was fun enough. People were now forming up circles, taking turns to get inside and perform for the crowd. Even through the loud music, I could hear the claps and shouts and cheers. They seemed to enjoy the moment.Why shouldn’t I? I joined the circle, and its excitement immediately enveloped me. People were happy about my addition, “Robbie! Dance for us!” Sure thing; dance is just dance. Not caring about the purpose, I found my body miraculously free from stiffness – singing to the DJ’s song, shaking my shoulder, jumping up after a squat, I felt I could do anything. Gasps and wonders were vocalized from the crowd, and my heart felt happy.If you ask me if dancing at the Winter Formal turned my world upside down, I would say no. I still look out for purposes in life and try my best to pursue the ends. But one thing is certain: next time there is a dance, I will be the first to sign up.",
    "Supps": "题目：Describe the world you come from — for example, your family, community or school — and tell us how your world has shaped your dreams and aspirations.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          My friendship with Zhang meant the whole world to me. Seeing it gradually fade away changed me forever.“WHY DO YOU DESERVE IT MORE THAN US?” ;The cold February air froze at Zhang’s balcony. Zhang avoided my ardent eyes and fixed his on the lonely moon far above. He took a deep breath, tried to say something, but then paused midway. Never could I have expected my reunion with childhood buddy to go sour.“Why should students in Shanghai live the easy life? You do less homework, get all the possible opportunities, and then have better access to top universities. Why should we, students from small towns, who actually work harder, face more frustrating competition in Gaokao? What makes the difference? Noble birth?”I wasn’t born in Shanghai; like Zhang, I came from Dongxiang. My family left this sleepy small town only a few years ago. I deeply love my hometown.Zhang turned to me and fixed his eyes in mine, as if to demand an answer. I did not dare to say a word; his query remained in the air, striking in silence repeatedly. Education inequality was too delicate a topic to touch upon. I patted his back and tried to say something hopeful. “Just believe me. things will get better. Keep working and we may end up in the same college.” But the more I spoke, the more I found my words pale. A promise was too weak with words alone - I needed to solve the problem with action. ;But what exactly was I trying to solve? Discrepancy between Zhang and me? The problematic college entrance system in China? Or, social inequality? The vicious institution that tore two best friends apart? All of them, if I could. I had to help.Seeing the drastic difference between Zhang and me redefined my identity. I came to realize just how lucky I was. Not every kid from my hometown can move to cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Compared to my peers back home, I have been spending and taking much more than my share. Endowed with the resources others might not possess, I must shoulder greater responsibilities that concern more than myself. I want to work so that the less well-offs are better off. After all, our lives are not just our own. We live as a whole, as one species on this blue planet. We need each other. We are each other. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience that is important to you. What about this quality or accomplishment makes you proud, and how does it relate to the person you are?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I kept trembling; the thirty-second-long standing ovation overwhelmed me. I stepped up to the front of stage, took a bow towards the chapel full of students and teachers, and felt incredibly relieved and proud. Speaking out the hard truth about a community I so loved was no easy task, but I was glad that I made it through.Two months before my exchange year ended at St. Andrew’s, the upper school chaplain came to me and invited me to deliver a senior homily during a chapel service. “We all would love to hear your perspective,” he said. What an honor. I agreed immediately, promising him a good talk and gave him a big smile. However, when I started to craft my ten-minute script, I fell into utter bewilderment. ;It was not that I had nothing to say about this community; a year’s observation gave me more than enough material. I knew I wanted to direct people’s attention to the issue of inclusion, telling them how grueling my first few months were as a newcomer, and encouraging them to open up their worlds for the next new kid on campus. But I had a huge concern – the topic was so drenched with personal feelings that it might come off as a cacophonous accusation, one of those I-was-struggling-but-no-one-cared complaints. I did have a difficult time at the beginning, but it was nobody’s fault. I would hate to see my friends take upon themselves for the institutionalized indifference; I would hate to see them suffer.I could always turn to safer and easier topics - talk about Texan stereotypes, for instance. Such analysis from the standpoint of a foreign student would definitely bring sensational amusement. A love letter to football would work as well; everyone loves football here in Austin. I gave both topics a try, but the more I wrote, the more I felt the urge to go back to the discussion over inclusion. “What the community needed to hear must be said,” I decided. Never shall I let myself choose what is safe over what is important. I had to be audacious in the face of such a decision, even if it meant coming across as reckless to the entire school. ;In my speech, I poured my heart out. I talked about the agony of being left alone on campus in September, the joy of being surprisingly coronated homecoming prince that same month, and most importantly, the profound confusion in between. I said I really wondered why a community as friendly as St. Andrew’s could make a person feel so isolated at one point. I proposed that we make a difference together and make our friendliness more explicit. After all, no one should feel deserted.The speech was a success. Compliments and applause and hugs enveloped me, but those were not my biggest takeaways. What defined this experience was the risk I took in hope of prompting a positive change. It felt great because I was brave."

    "CommonApp": "I’ve always had my feminist beliefs but I didn’t always have the words for them. I am lucky that I’ve got a happy and equal family. When I was young, I never experienced assaulting words or rude behavior from my classmates. I used to believe the world was full of nothing but love and respect.However, things started to change when I became older. At the age of eleven, due to my father’s work site transfer, my whole family moved to Swaziland, where I encountered the term 'feminism' for the first time. While attending a seminar held by a senior female student, I learned that many females are suffering pressure and pain from prejudice and negative stereotypes. At that time, I also had the ability to read news on the computer by myself for the first time. When I read the discussion board under news about a woman who was raped, I saw that many people blamed her. They called her nasty words and said it was her fault for wearing too little.I was shocked. I could not believe so many people held ideas like this. I was really scared at first. “What if this happens on me?” I asked myself. I started to understand that I had only experienced a small part of the world. Many women do suffer unfairness and pain from other people.My mind became unprecedentedly clear. I wanted to help other people and me who have suffered or will suffer unequal treatment in the world. I remembered the student at the seminar who said that feminism is a belief in the economic, political and social equality of all genders and the objection to gender discrimination of any kind.Therefore, I became a feminist.My understanding of feminism deepened after I immersed myself in numerous books and articles about feminism. Li Yin He and Simone de Beauvoir became my favorite enlightenment teachers. The Second Sex became a must-read at bedtime. Back to China, I joined Lean In. At first I was only a volunteer, but my translation skills, maturity, and knowledge base granted me an exception to become the youngest and only under-age member.I tried to promote feminist ideas to the public by translating and sharing articles on the official WeChat account of Lean In Shenzhen, where thousands of people can read them. I also became an editor at the Female Leadership Cultivation Association. On the stage of these organizations I talked about sexual harassment and sexual assault and discussed how women can become truly independent and self-reliant. My own theories sublimated as I translated articles and discussed my ideas with others. Rather than just reading books at home, I started cooperating with people to run the organization, speaking out to influence others, and discussing feminism with people who read my articles.When someone asks me why I am a feminist, I tell them it is because I do not want to be limited to a stereotype. I tell them I decided to spread the idea of feminism so that more people can live for themselves instead of living “like men” or “like women”. My mother is a woman who is not “like women” in my grandmother’s eyes. She did not spend all her time on her children after marriage and she is still studying for her Master’s degree now. I want to protect women like my mother. I hope all men and women will not be limited to a stereotype.",
    "Supps": "题目：Tell us a story that helps us better understand a person, place, or thing you find inspiring.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          People make eye contact with each other every day, but most of us won’t notice it. For me, eye contact is really important and amazing. People say that the eyes are windows to the soul, and I see many people’s kindness and friendliness from those windows.My family and I often moved around to different countries, different cities in China, and different areas in the same cities to live. Therefore, I often had to deal with new communities and strangers around me. But I don’t feel worried because of my willingness to make eye contact with strangers. I found that when I make eye contact with strangers with a smile in my eyes, most of their eyes express kindness too. In this situation, all I need to do is to say a greeting, and then the stranger and I will start to communicate and we won’t be strangers anymore.As I grew up, meeting and communicating with new people became easier and easier. Sometimes even in places like elevators, which are pressured and uncomfortable, after making eye contact, I and others will be able to talk to each other with ease. Old grandmothers will ask me about my school. Parents will ask me whether middle school or high school is harder and will talk about their own kids. Little children will show me their lollipops.Sometimes all we need to do to break the ice is to raise our head and look at others with a smile in our eyes.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Tell us about a small goal you hope to achieve, whether in the next 10 days, 10 months, or 10 years.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I hope I can get the qualification of being a Level 3 Translator and Interpreter from passing the English Levels 3 translation and interpretation tests on China Accreditation Test for Translators and Interpreters (CATTI) in 10 months.I began translating when I joined NOVA magazine club in Grade 11. NOVA is a magazine where we post articles we translated from other sources. Since then, I have used and developed my translation skills adroitly, and by joining more organizations thousands of people can read the book and articles I translated.Translation changed the way I think. It teaches me to think from others’ position. I started to understand why many people keep silent when they experienced sexual harassment after translating an article written by a victim. After all, when facing the danger of losing jobs or degrees and the possibility of not being believed, we cannot expect victims to always speak out. Translation forces me to present and understand ideas that I may not agree with. This understanding helps me shape my own ideas and theories. I have become less biased and can see the experiences of others more clearly.Passing the CATTI does not only qualify my translation level, but also represents my mature thoughts. Translation helps me understand that while facing different opinions I should think “Why would they think that way?” and not “How dare they think like that!” It gives me patience to listen to different voices and the empathy to understand them."

    "CommonApp": "“Time for lunch!”I walked to the table together with Yue. It had been my daily routine for the past three weeks. Yue was six years older than me, still young and pretty. But, like the other workers at China-Dolls, an inspiring charity here in Beijing, she was sitting on a wheelchair. Struck by the rare disease Osteogenesis Imperfecta, she had suffered countless fractures since she was young.“So you are going back to school tomorrow?” she asked, taking some rice in her bowl.“Yup. Summer vacation is over.”“You really helped us a lot these days.” She smiled, ”We really appreciate it.”“I think I’m the person who should say thank you!” I said earnestly.Not merely an act of manners, this was purely the statement of fact. Ever since I first met a disabled boy at the age of 7 during a community survey conducted by my social-worker Mom, I had always been curious about disabled people. What were their lives like? How did they think about themselves, and others? On my path of seeking answers, frustrating obstacles always seemed to come along. Once I came up with a plan to communicate with deaf children through letters, and excitedly went to Haidian deaf school. But after waiting for 3 hours at the school gate blitzed by gusts of cold winds, I was finally rejected by a teacher decisively. How fortunate I was to meet Yue and her colleagues, who always solved these puzzles on my mind so patiently!“Well, why so solemn!” She obviously didn’t realize how grateful I was, “So do you have lots of homework during school days?”“Definitely.” My workload had been so gigantic ever since I decided to study in the US. Especially so, as I had chosen to remain in the Gaokao track and climb the ultimate sky ladder of Chinese high school education with all my dear friends. Time had become a luxury that I could barely afford. Every morning I got out the SAT books as breakfast, and every night, after I finished my school homework, I worked on my English writing. Even on the subway I remembered being consumed by mastering Chinese prose. It made me think that we actually all have our own challenges, even if they aren’t disabilities. We just struggle in different ways. “But up to now I can handle it.” I pulled myself together.“Cool. So you still have time for your hobbies? What do you usually do in your spare time?”“Well, I love swimming.”“Really? I love swimming, too! Swimming helps us OI patients exercise our backs and avoid scoliosis.”I looked at her thin legs curling on the wheelchair. I used to wonder how she felt about exposing her bent, strange body to the world. But since then I had totally changed my mind. When listening to their amazing stories, I admired them from the bottom of my heart. Seeing them steering the wheelchairs artfully in the office, busy organizing activities or raising money, I found that disabled people could have great ability. When I joined their dance party, where everyone, whether sitting on a wheelchair or on the floor, danced hand-in-hand, I learned how to bridge the gulf of ignorance. I had learned that, despite the difference between our bodies, we are all human beings after all. I finally realized the missing point of that deaf children project. Instead of “patronizing” the disabled as if some distant saints, we should ”reach out and understand” them.Seeing Yue’s face light up when talking about her favorite thing, I suggested, “So, how about going swimming together next Saturday?”She giggled, “Why not?”",
    "Supps": "题目：Describe your favorite academic subject and explain how it has influenced you. \n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I have been curious about sociology ever since I was young. With my Mom a professor of sociology and my Dad doing research on anti-poverty issues for decades, I was always surrounded by discussion of things like social stratification and discrimination. Our bookshelves were primarily occupied by books such as Durkheim’s Suicide and Tocqueville’s Democracy in America. Although I could not fully understand them, I was intrigued by the special ways sociologists view the world. ;However, even though my passion in this field has strived through all these years I have never learned sociology systematically since there’s no course in my high school. But I have groped for its meaning by myself for years. The definition of sociology is the study of social behavior and society, but that is a bit abstract. As far as I am concerned, sociology is a subject to present, explain and predict social phenomena. To me, it is like a magical window that engenders me towards tranquility and satisfaction. When looking through it, I find the clarity behind many seemingly unreasonable phenomena and understand better the behaviors of other people. Why people commit suicide? Why are there always wealth and poverty? There are hided rules behind them.Besides, unlike most other subjects I have studied, which seek an ultimate answer, sociology nourishes so many options, interpreting social phenomena from different perspectives. For example, the three basic theories-function, conflict and interaction, none of them is absolutely right. Rather, they are three different approaches. Although I used to be eager to find a completely right answer for everything, the approach of sociology makes me more composed and tolerant, accepting various possibilities at the same time.Sociology has always been considered useless in China. However I always felt it has a great deal to offer. When once working for a Chinese NGO called China-Dolls, founded to help patients with a rare disease, I was exposed to many stories of family struggles, and ways that poverty seemed to torture these people at every turn. I wonder if these problems can be examined with a combination of math and sociology methods, providing new, more creative options for policy makers to help these families. I really hope to develop this approach during my college years.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What is the one thing that you think sets you apart from other candidates applying to the University of California?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I never doubted that I was one of a kind, because I came from Mars.Well, please don’t laugh. Let me tell you my story with that distant, red planet.I remember asking my Mom hundreds of times when I was young, where did I come from? She was equivocal at first but, finally, she said to me one day, mysteriously, “You know what, you came from Mars!”Wow, that was a big secret. I tried to keep it to myself, but I couldn’t. I told everyone that I was a Martian. Of course, they laughed at me. Yet even as I grew up and began to realize how ridiculous this sounded, I still thought it was theoretically possible. Ever since the big bang took place, particles have been hovering around the universe for 13.8 billion years. Some of them now constituted me, but who knows where they were billions of years ago? Why couldn’t they have come from Mars? ;I was attracted by everything related to Mars. Lots of movies have depicted it, so often delineated as silent and lethargic, just like a desert struck by sandstorm. Martians were often portrayed as ugly, with callous hearts. But I knew Mars wasn’t like that. ;I often dreamed about it. Once I developed wings, and flew off to Mars for a visit. There were no humans, nor plants nor animals. I imagined some exotic “beings” who were not born to be anything. Instead, they chose what to be every day. If I wanted to be a sunflower this day, I became a sunflower. And if tomorrow I wanted to be a puppy, I just turned myself into a cute, fluffy puppy. Although there was no language, my “beings” could communicate through a special melody of the universe, a kind of a wave. ;I came to believe there must be some special relationship between Mars and me. I am always thrilled about the latest development in the exploration of Mars. With luck, one day in the future, I will have the chance to go home!\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Confidently I walked onto the stage, and introduced my applied math solution to the judges. ;Several weeks before, my Mom had bought various house plants considered effective for absorbing air pollutants. I was curious about them and hypothesized that there must be some relationship between the roughness of a plant’s surface and its ability to absorb. To find out, I started to design an experiment.The first challenge was finding a way to measure “roughness”, such an abstract concept. I searched for ways it could be quantified and thought of the method to measure machine parts. I wondered if that method could be applied to the surface of leaves. Browsing industry websites, I found a formula including three parameters for measurement. ;However, when trying it, I found there were so many fluffs on the leaves that it wasn't possible to measure accurately. Also, they were too soft when compared with machine parts. So I had to come up with some other way.Then, I remembered a BBC documentary The Secret Life of Chaos which introduced a concept named fractal, a math theory defining the irregularity of an object’s border and fractal dimension. Simply speaking, it used little squares to map out the border of an object, and then calculated its overall dimension according to a calculus formula. Could I adapt this to measure surface roughness? I had to try. Although it was usually used on the hard surfaces of planes, my subject was soft leaves. I experimented by crosscutting the leaves and, then, using a microscope, taking pictures through the lens. After several tries, I finally managed to get a good image, and, using some other specialist software I found online, I was able to calculate the dimensions of the leaves’ surface, and its irregularity or toughness.Having come up with these creative solutions to solve the most challenging issues, I was able to finish other more routine parts of my research smoothly. ;After my presentation, the judges complimented me for using a theoretical geometrical concept to solve a practical biology problem. However, it was the joy of experimentation that was my greatest reward. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time. \n                                  \n                                      \n                                          After co-founding a new charitable association among 28 high schools in Beijing and shouldering the responsibility of collecting and spreading charitable ideas, I suddenly found myself burning the midnight oil everyday contacting different charity clubs and summarizing their activities. Still, I struggled to finish the infinite work. I knew I had to take a different approach.Later I read about a theory called “monkey off the back”. Every monkey represented a single task, and a good leader has to delegate those troublesome monkeys to other team members. It felt so right! I could see that I had put too many monkeys on my back, and they had straddled me with their prehensile tails. I convened a special meeting of students from each member club.“I have a new plan to operate our association, and I need your help.” Spreading a paper on the table and writing down seven districts in Beijing, I said “Up to now we have recruited clubs from these districts. We should have one or two people responsible for the clubs in each district. They will get each club’s latest news, inform each club of the activities of the association and regularly report their work to me.” Then, I only needed to talk with several people instead of all 28 clubs - much less monkeys ;“But if we need suggestions when holding activities, can we still ask you?” a boy asked. ;“Well, you first need to talk to the one in charge of your district. I will still help you promote activities or contact other clubs, but I cannot talk with each one of you every time something comes up. Otherwise, there would be too many dialog boxes in my WeChat and I would start to forget things... People in charge will collect and tell me those questions.” I explained, pushing away another monkey’s arm about to put on my shoulder.  ;Happily, they seemed to understand my point. ;Once the administrative network was mapped out, I had full confidence that our work would be more effective in the days that followed. And after a while, it did make such a difference. I learned that good leaders have to “let monkeys off their backs”, while making sure that everyone is taking care of his monkeys!"

    "CommonApp": "In one of my childhood memories, the younger me was painting elatedly on a huge, white canvas, moving my chubby arms and humming a pleasant tune. I marveled as the different colors accidentally mixed together, roiling and thickening, becoming more miraculous—until my mother reached down and deftly grabbed my brush. Looking at me, she calmly stated that I needed to control my strokes more carefully. Then, she moved her wrist along the canvas, covering my melting pot of colors with her ordered, refined lines. I wanted to argue, but her skill was impressive. Careful control, I thought, was the key to success.A decade later, a chance encounter sparked my interest in ultimate frisbee, and inspired me to found a frisbee club at my school. Without much leadership experience, I naturally fell back on mom’s lesson to exert precise control. I personally chose the club’s name, Free Bees Ultimate, and planned our training schedule. Feeling the need to assert my authority, I would shout at them to run faster and fight harder, while they preferred to relax and joke with each other. I was frustrated. Why didn’t they care about the club like I did? Why wouldn’t they work to improve themselves? What’s worse, many people lost interest and stopped attending training altogether. I was shaken. The club was falling apart.One night, as I practiced painting, my club still lingered on my mind. I stared at the picture in front of me. Smooth curves, neatly separated colors. Perfect, just like always. Wait, not always. I remembered that sometimes, my mom would leave me to paint on my own, with nothing to stop me from doing whatever I fancied. I picked colors randomly from the box, used multiple brushes at once, and painted no less wantonly than Jackson Pollack. By the time I finally stopped, the animals I had meant to draw were unrecognizable, but in their place was a marvelous array of colors and shapes.Putting down the brush, my mind returned to the present. My team and I all wanted the club to succeed. Maybe rather than my guiding hand, the club needed to follow their passion.The next day, the Free Bees met for practice. Instead of deciding everything on my own, I started to ask the players for their opinions, and let them decide the practice regimen. Despite my previous emphasis on scrimmages, my members chose to play games such as ‘the box,’ which mixed useful drills with fun. Maybe I was wrong before; I should have been more open to the wishes of the team. So, at the suggestion of my teammates, I contacted the leader of my city’s frisbee league and invited him to give a talk to our team. That day, watching my teammates listen to the talk intently and then practice enthusiastically, I couldn’t help but smile.Several months later, we decided to hold the first ever youth frisbee tournament in China. This time we split up the work among the team, with each person choosing what he or she was good at. Finally, after months of intense preparation, I was proud to see the field filled with more than 100 young people from all over China competing and sweating together for the glory of sport. It was a tournament for teenagers, and more importantly, organized by teenagers. After an exhausting day, my teammates and I hugged each other tightly and threw ourselves on the ground. Amid the laughter and warmth, I couldn’t have been more moved.Now, I still paint. Delineating contours and filling colors, I know the importance of rules, but let creativity and imagination run free at the right time, and the canvas will be filled with free-flowing, brilliant colors. Whether painting or running a frisbee club, sometimes having control requires giving up control.Pencils sharpened, brushes cleaned, I can’t wait to start my next masterpiece.",

When I first read 1984 by George Orwell several years ago, it fundamentally challenged my idea of media and its function. Before encountering the novel, I regarded media as trustworthy stewards of information. But in the book things are different. At one point, the government misses its target for boot production, so it uses the media to retroactively lower the target. The corruption of the media is so complete that “even the date of the year had become uncertain.” Bothered, I took another look at reality, and discovered that information control wasn’t fictional: advertisements lie about their products; governments edit their poverty statistics... The book demolished my view of an infallible media and made me wonder: is any media trustworthy?In my junior year, when I founded a social media platform called UsTerns to transmit information about studying abroad to Chinese students, this question weighed on me. In every article I write, I feel the temptation to twist facts to my side. For example, when I was recommending a university, I researched upsides, such as the location. But I knew I had an obligation to present the downside, and I did: the school lacked facilities like libraries.I think I owe the success of UsTerns in part to 1984. It reminded me of my responsibility to the truth, and now my viewers regularly praise my even-handedness. 1984 showed me how dangerous media can be, and that is exactly what makes good media so important.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：We are a community with quirks, both in language and in traditions.

She’s a witch!”It was the first time I had carried my lunch to school, and people surrounded me, astounded by my bizarre dumpling accompaniment. Normally Chinese people eat dumplings with vinegar or soy source, and my choice, a mixture of traditional oriental food and freedom sauce, just seemed strange.But for me, mixing cultures is itself a very old tradition. It started two thousand years ago, when a troop of Roman soldiers visited Chang’an, China’s ancient capital. Most of them left, but some decided to settle down and raise families. That’s why many members of my family, which is from Chang’an, have blue eyes and curly hair. And this mixed identity is at the core of my personality as well as my appearance—besides dumpling philosophy, my slang, music, and movies all come from around the world. Once this bothered me and made me struggle to fit in, but as I grew older and traveled more, I found my traits could help me to better communicate with anyone. As I shared slang with Japanese friends and music with British ones, I realized my quirks made me not just Chinese, but a citizen of the world.Some years later, with renewed confidence, I decided to try again. I brought a big box of dumplings and ketchup to school for my friends. They were reluctant at first, but when they finally tried it, their eyes widened in amazement. I smiled. Sometimes good things come from mixing traditions together."

She just lost her mom, the amazing woman who had worked three jobs to make her college dream come true, but she has no time to moan. Today is her interview day that determines her family’s future.    This is all my imagination. I know nothing about that lady, but I often find myself reading other people’s life stories. I’ve never thought about people this way five years ago, when I had only two things in mind: homework and play. My life totally changed, however, when I started making pen pals.Daryna, a 15-year-old girl from Ukraine, emailed me one day in 2013. I clicked into Daryna’s profile picture in curiosity. In the photo, smiling at me with tender green eyes, is a pretty girl with long blonde hair. Her serene gaze seemed to break through the screen and come alive.Wow, this is what a Ukrainian girl looks like! I thought in amazement. At that moment, with the girl named Daryna quietly looking at me, the country called Ukraine was suddenly not so foreign. I felt an urge to learn more about the girl who I share a digital connection with yet lived a completely different life. Daryna lives in a small town in Eastern Ukraine and steps up to look after her five-year-old brother because her parents are often away. She draws beautiful water color and aspires to become an interior designer. One day Daryna sent me a photo of her neighborhood. Picturing myself standing between the gray brick buildings under the green trees, I tried to imagine what life is like for Daryna: how she walked home down that street, carrying her portfolio; how she sat and watched her brother riding on the rusty swing; how she bent over the easel and paint the petals on her flower. Hundreds of questions formed in my head. What makes her smile? Does she have the same adolescent worries as I do? At this moment while I look at her picture, what is she doing? Suddenly I want to get into Daryna’s head and experience her life for one day. Looking at the photos, I got a glimpse of Daryna. I felt her dream and affection. Although we are thousands miles away, our email exchanges have woven our lives together. I put one more piece into my puzzle of who Daryna is. Three months ago Daryna sent me a map of Ukraine with these words on the back: “I sent you the map of my whole country because you deserve to know it”. From these simple words, I could feel Daryna’s ardent pride of her country and her invitation to let me to go one step deeper into her soul. I stared into the little spot called “Korostyshiv”. There lives a girl I’ve never met, but our hearts are connected. Going through Daryna’s emails, photos, and map, I try to put together the puzzle of who Daryna is. Likewise, I try to put together the puzzles of the twenty pen pals from eleven countries I have corresponded with. However, after five years, I started to realize that the puzzles will never be completed, for the word “human” bears so much spoken and unspoken joy and pain. I can never really understand someone.  However, it is so amazing to think that our earth is alive with the sparkling stories of 7 billion human beings! How can I ever feel alone in the universe? I am connected to every human being in the world, my actions powered by the spirits of 7 billion people.  With the exchange of emails, that person on the opposite of the screen gradually becomes a person of flesh and bone. At the same time, the 7 billion souls become one organism—humanity.",

Classmates sent me twenty messages congratulating my courage, girls chatted with me about finding a girlfriend like it’s the most normal thing on earth, a teacher collected me into his arms when I told him, in tears, that the girl I like just got a boyfriend....... Nothing about me had changed—I’m still the drama enthusiast and a hardworking student. Free from the burden of concealing my true self, I feel an immense joy. ;“You are blessed to be in this school, Wanze.

    "CommonApp": "That lady walking towards me has a sorrowful resolution, her lips pressing tightly together, eyes gazing straight ahead. She just lost her mom, the amazing woman who had worked three jobs to make her college dream come true, but she has no time to moan. Today is her interview day that determines her family’s future.    This is all my imagination. I know nothing about that lady, but I often find myself reading other people’s life stories. I’ve never thought about people this way five years ago, when I had only two things in mind: homework and play. My life totally changed, however, when I started making pen pals.Daryna, a 15-year-old girl from Ukraine, emailed me one day in 2013. I clicked into Daryna’s profile picture in curiosity. In the photo, smiling at me with tender green eyes, is a pretty girl with long blonde hair. Her serene gaze seemed to break through the screen and come alive.Wow, this is what a Ukrainian girl looks like! I thought in amazement. At that moment, with the girl named Daryna quietly looking at me, the country called Ukraine was suddenly not so foreign. I felt an urge to learn more about the girl who I share a digital connection with yet lived a completely different life. Daryna lives in a small town in Eastern Ukraine and steps up to look after her five-year-old brother because her parents are often away. She draws beautiful water color and aspires to become an interior designer. One day Daryna sent me a photo of her neighborhood. Picturing myself standing between the gray brick buildings under the green trees, I tried to imagine what life is like for Daryna: how she walked home down that street, carrying her portfolio; how she sat and watched her brother riding on the rusty swing; how she bent over the easel and paint the petals on her flower. Hundreds of questions formed in my head. What makes her smile? Does she have the same adolescent worries as I do? At this moment while I look at her picture, what is she doing? Suddenly I want to get into Daryna’s head and experience her life for one day. Looking at the photos, I got a glimpse of Daryna. I felt her dream and affection. Although we are thousands miles away, our email exchanges have woven our lives together. I put one more piece into my puzzle of who Daryna is. Three months ago Daryna sent me a map of Ukraine with these words on the back: “I sent you the map of my whole country because you deserve to know it”. From these simple words, I could feel Daryna’s ardent pride of her country and her invitation to let me to go one step deeper into her soul. I stared into the little spot called “Korostyshiv”. There lives a girl I’ve never met, but our hearts are connected. Going through Daryna’s emails, photos, and map, I try to put together the puzzle of who Daryna is. Likewise, I try to put together the puzzles of the twenty pen pals from eleven countries I have corresponded with. However, after five years, I started to realize that the puzzles will never be completed, for the word “human” bears so much spoken and unspoken joy and pain. I can never really understand someone.  However, it is so amazing to think that our earth is alive with the sparkling stories of 7 billion human beings! How can I ever feel alone in the universe? I am connected to every human being in the world, my actions powered by the spirits of 7 billion people.  With the exchange of emails, that person on the opposite of the screen gradually becomes a person of flesh and bone. At the same time, the 7 billion souls become one organism—humanity.",

Confronted with this unexpected task, our amazing teamwork made us survive and flourish.

Free from the burden of concealing my true self, I feel an immense joy. ;“You are blessed to be in this school, Wanze.

    "CommonApp": "I had one minute to pitch my startup company, BlinkCard.During that minute, I explained the idea behind BlinkCard – “to supply a pre-paid debit card to teenagers, backed by apps that help them manage money with supervision from their parents.” As I paused for air, the investor didn’t even glance at me but stared intensely at the ground like Rodin’s statue of The Thinker. After a few minutes of rumination, he turned me down. “You’re too young. Focus on school.”Over the next five months, seven more investors rejected me.Just as hope began to fade, my dad took me on a brief vacation to California. Cruising down the highway, I recalled a Silicon Valley investor named Mr. Kong, whom I had once met at a MIT conference. Since we were in the area, I decided to pay him a visit.We met at a cozy coffee shop in Palo Alto. As I began telling him about my travels, Mr. Kong received a call. I glanced at the vibrating phone: there was a picture of a baby on the screen. Mr. Kong politely muted the call, but I insisted he should take it, sensing that the baby on the screen was his son. I sat there patiently as he spoke on the phone, thinking about my own dad who had just flown halfway around the world to see me. When the call ended, I asked about his son, who is no longer the baby on the screen, but now an executive at Uber. Mr. Kong confessed that he wished he had spent more time with his children when they were young. I was surprised by the relaxed and intimate tone our conversation had taken. Upon his request, I briefly showed him BlinkCard’s prototype and business plan. He shared his advice with me like a partner, or more so, like a father. When we parted ways, I left with no expectations, only good memories.    Over the next few months, I kept in touch with Mr. Kong, sharing an occasional story from my life, and asking for guidance in my development of BlinkCard. One night, I picked up my phone and saw a text from Mr. Kong. “I’m in for $150k!” In my shock, I dropped my phone. Later, I lay on my bed and tried to recall our meeting at that coffee shop. Why did he invest? I didn’t even explain all the details of the business plan. Could our casual conversation have been more effective than a well-reasoned pitch?My question was answered at the Wharton LBW Summer program. I had a conversation about entrepreneurial education with the founder of the program, Julian Krinsky. Afterwards, he invited me to his house for brunch with his family, where I learned that he emigrated from South Africa and became a nationally ranked tennis player. In turn, I told him about the culture shock I experienced studying in Germany and U.S., the process of conceiving BlinkCard, the frustration of facing rejections from investors, and finally the unexpected story of Mr. Kong in the coffee shop.Before I left, he handed me a thousand dollar check and said, “This’ll be another good story for you to tell!”At that moment, I understood the power of connecting with other people on an emotional level. To me, business is not strictly about cold numerical values, cutthroat competition, coinciding self-interests, or financial returns. Rather, business is another realm in which humans can relate to one another with empathy and sincerity; the goal should be to form lasting connections that can weather hardships and work toward the common good of all involved.I had meticulously constructed an elevator pitch intended to sell my idea to investors, but it failed. With Mr. Kong and Mr. Krinsky, I built a genuine relationship; they invested in my startup because they were emotionally invested in my stories—and I in theirs.",

Motivated to recruit, we put up posters around the school. Our marketing strategy wasn’t effective as they were mixed with the posters from well-developed clubs, like Model UN that touted their achievements and appealed to more students. ;We had no award, no funding, and no legacy. ;However, I soon realized we couldn’t change what we didn’t have but could amplify what we did have – the advantages of filmmaking for people to share their ideas and experiences. But we needed a creative way to deliver this message to others. One day, while in the bathroom, the idea of putting our posters on the bare wall above the urinal unexpectedly came to mind. Nobody could possibly miss this location and our poster! With no competition, the bathroom walls became our marketing area. ;Immediately, everybody in the school talked about the Filmmakers Club. My inbox grew exponentially. With a surplus of student endorsements, the principal approved the club, which has since grown to a strong team with 39 members. In the years since, we’ve created everything from advertisements for school clubs, to fundraising videos for a children’s cancer organization and an NGO that helps children whose parents are in prison. We also popularized the bathroom advertisement in my school! ;It was creativity that got our foot in the door, and I will bring that creativity to the Duke community. ;"

    "CommonApp": "Scars stared back at me as I looked in the mirror. I reached my hand out, as if to touch the suffering. I vividly remembered the moment that unexpectedly shattered my peaceful life. Like frames of a film, I could see the scene flashing in front of me. Tears fell from my cheek silently. I had fallen off a motor bike and smashed my face into the rigid cement. Blood burst from my mouth. Half of my face was paralyzed. I had no idea that my future would be met with ceaseless stabbing pain from acupuncture needles and multifarious medicines.I would spend Kindergarten in a mask, frequently visiting the hospital. I began to receive abnormal gazes from strangers. To make up for my obvious scars, I strove to excel in other areas so that people would pay attention to my achievements instead of my physical appearance. I worked hard in every subject, took part in mathematics competitions in primary school, and forced myself to read abysmal Chinese literature at very young age. I tried to be encouraging to others and show as much optimism as possible, often suppressing my negative feelings. But I was still afraid to smile until the day I met the 10-year-old girl in the community voluntary organization.Half-burnt face, with skin grafting evident, her leg had been amputated below the knee, and she walked with a crutch. She stood in front of me and I suddenly forgot the scars on my face. I felt an instant familiarity when our eyes met, immediately accompanied with grieved sadness and resignation.The next time I saw her was during Christmas pageant rehearsals. I heard shouting: “I will learn to dance! Like a swan!” I saw contempt, disdain, and scorn from the other children as she tried to dance across the stage. Memories of judgment came flooding back. I tried to avoid making eye contact. But her eyes stared at me, burning brightly. Her passion was like fire and extinguished others’ dismissal. She was filled with pride. Her artificial leg, exposed crudely in front of everyone, at first frightened me and evoked a shameful cowardice in my heart. Suddenly she fell down and I could feel the pain of embarrassment. But seconds later, she stood up, clenched her teeth, and continued on in the middle of the studio, rotating as if to reach the untouchable sunlight.The English Speech Competition arrived shortly after. Walking onto the stage, looking at the audience, I kept thinking of the looks that haunted my childhood. The moment my eyes met with the scornful eyes of the boy in the front row, I shrank back. I didn’t want think of myself that way. But I carried on with confident smile and raised my head as I walked to the podium. The burned girl’s face appeared in my head but was quickly met with resolve and determination. Half an hour later, speech completed with an impassioned tone, I shed my self-consciousness. Although I made some mistakes, I heard a roar of applause. I was stunned. I had finally stopped obsessing about what others thought of me physically. Three months later, the Erhu Level Examination forced me to go on stage again. Picking up the Erhu in the dusty corner, I thought of all my gloomy days practicing in a dark room. I was so fearful that I would make a mistake that would cause unimaginable consequences. Looking at the Erhu in my hand, touching the horsehair, my old friend was with me once again. I carefully held the scarred resonating box in my hands and began to play. I was totally immersed in the emotion of the moment. Finishing the melody with some imperfections, I raised my head up, smiled at the judges, and exhaled comfortably, appreciating the true beauty that is rooted in the imperfections of all individuals.",
    "Supps": "题目：Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time. \n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I am the leader of my astronomy club, which has 36 members that are divided into  ;  ;three departments: International, High School, and the Talented Elementary School Students department. In 2015, I attended the Sixth Developmental Astronomical Forum held in Shanghai, leading 8 members, including three members from the Talented department.Once we arrived, the 5 high school students became careless and left out the young gifted students as they discussed their plans for the conference. I was observing them and trying to make some changes to adjust the attitude of the high school students to optimize the overall team’s performance. Thus, I quietly encouraged the younger students to go and talk with the organizational committee. These students ultimately came up with several creative ideas for our presentation and provided well-thought out suggestions for us to present on a new technology that focuses on light pollution. At first I was simply trying to unite the team members but I was shocked that the youngest members of our group had considered the group’s goal so thoroughly while the older students had simply argued. Determined to take greater step towards fulfilling everyone’s potential, I further guided these three young boys to boldly communicate with the student leaders from The High School Affiliated To Renmin University of China about their previous experience. I did this in an attempt to discover the most important material to focus on to convince the judges of our club’s uniqueness while considering the two minute time constraint. ;It was apparent that the high school students, who were still arguing without progress, were unwilling to listen to me or the younger members of our group so I fought harder to convey the importance of balancing cooperation and individuality. Through these experiences together, the older group members realized their inadequacy and eventually, our whole group worked together.While leading this group, I united the team and ensured we had our best possible performance. I also learned an important lesson as a leader: regardless of my team members’ age or ability, I should never underestimate an individual’s potential contribution.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What would you say is your greatest talent or skill?How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time? \n                                  \n                                      \n                                          It is astonishing to think that the cumbersome, gray-like monster with a long neck, the Erhu, has been a part of my life for ten years now. Mastering the Erhu has required a truly massive amount of dedication. First, I had to memorize musical notes, then I needed to learn how to read music, and ultimately understand staccato, martele, common special signs. Since there is always friction between the horsehair bow and the strings stretching across the hexagonal body of the Erhu, I needed to understand which kind of rosin to use and the exact position my hands needed to be in so that I could produce the beautiful music that the Erhu is capable of making. ;However, even after fully understanding these technical skills, there was still more I had to learn. Sitting in the dark practice room, I was required to memorize different tunes and listen to various songs in an effort to feel the composer’s emotions. I learned about composer Abing’s frustrating life, with both parents dead, and being forced to witness the Japanese take over his hometown of Wuxi. He often incorporated his outrage into the songs he composed, and I had to learn to convey these emotions in order to play Abing’s Two Moons Over the Fountain perfectly. ;Through doing research on his life, imagining myself in Abing’s environment, and reflecting deeply on the musical choices in his composition, I worked to connect with Abing’s heart. I began to love this approach to music, enduring all kinds of difficulties and emotions through the music of the Erhu. Through many hours of practicing, my hands became covered with bandages; the strong pull of the bows often caused my arms to ache at night. However, I persisted and was ultimately successful: onstage performing Two Moons Over the Fountain, I felt keenly Abing’s resignation and sorrow, as if I had also lived through such tragedy. I was able to achieve a new level with the Erhu, living the music rather than just playing it.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement? \n                                  \n                                      \n                                          At the age of 6, I paralyzed half of my face after falling off a motor bike.  ; I was emotionally numb due to the over exposure to pain. Tears fell from my cheek, displaying a pink hue as they mixed with the blood that burst from my mouth. In that moment, I had no idea that my future would be met with ceaseless stabbing pains from other people’s glares in addition to acupuncture needles and multifarious medicines. ;To compensate for my conspicuous facial scars, I strove to excel in other areas. I worked hard in every subject, took part in mathematics competitions in primary school, and forced myself to read Chinese literature at a very young age. I tried to be encouraging to others and often suppressed my true negative feelings by fake smiling.However, one day when I was volunteering I met a 10 year old girl named Wuyue. I felt an instant familiarity when our eyes met, immediately followed by tremendous grief and sadness：Wuyue had a half-burnt face, with severe skin grafting. Her leg had been amputated below the knee, and she walked with a crutch. But within seconds of meeting her, I watched as she began dancing! Her passion was like a great fire that burned through others’ dismissal. Her artificial leg, exposed crudely in front of everyone, frightened me at first. Suddenly, she fell down and I could feel the pain of her embarrassment. But within seconds, she stood up, clenched her teeth, and continued on in the middle of the studio .I couldn't take my eyes off her every laborious step as she danced away my need to compensate for my own scars. ;She reminded me of why I began playing the Erhu because I enjoyed the solitude. I had never played for others before but after watching Wuyue dance, I decided to put on a public performance. I meticulously held the instrument in my hands and began my performance. Half an hour later, with impassioned melody and a somewhat imperfect music score, I managed my very first performance with satisfaction.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe your favorite academic subject and explain how it has influenced you.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I am fascinated by the subject of Human Geography because it requires me to critically think about how to apply human nature to the environment we live in.  ;I am specifically interested in the ideas of “ centripetal Force”, an attitude that unites an entire nation such as the Chinese Spring Festive and “ Irredentism”, the act of reclaiming an area, such as China reclaiming Taiwan as part of its country. I also enjoy discussing pressing issues including the Israel and Palestine conflict, and problems between the Soviet Union and Northern Ireland. My favorite part of the subject is contextualizing these situations through historical research that also allows us to gain a solid understanding of other global conflicts as well as analyze the strategies behind the development of certain countries. Thanks to the knowledge provided in this class, I have developed a great passion in analyzing broad world issues including political science and economics, and now understand how they are related to our daily life. All of the skills I have learned in my Human Geography class culminated when I presented on Boko Haram overtaking ISIS as one of the deadliest terrorist groups in the world. Specifically, the presentation skills of content fluency and body language that I gained from this experience were especially beneficial. ;To further understand the relationships between countries, I participated in the UMUNC 2015, General Assembly United System(GAUS). I negotiated with delegates from across the world about humanitarian issues in the Ukraine crisis. Representing Australia, I engaged in the United Nations General Assembly 3rd Committee- Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee. Specifically, we discussed whether or not Russia should accept refugees fleeing from Ukraine by considering the societal disorder or the excessive rebuke of the United Nations as well as the disputes surrounding petroleum resources between these countries. ;Taking AP Human Geography, I have seen how knowledge can be applied and how superficial my viewpoints once were. As a result, I would like to pursue political science as a major so I can research the many relationships between countries across the globe. ;"

    "CommonApp": "“The next station is Shau Kei Wan. Doors will open on the right.” The subway lurched to a stop.With a shutter click of our camera, I captured the final piece for our mission, a selfie with the indigo wall of Shau Kei Wan station. For this second “Rainbow Station Challenge”, Chris and I set out to take selfies with walls of the seven hues of the rainbows that embellished Hong Kong’s MTR stations.It began two summers ago, when returning from my first year in the United States, I noticed the security guard at my apartment no longer recognized me despite the years of conversations we shared in the past. And the bridge I used to pass through every day to get to the bus stop? Gone. My connection with Beijing felt rusted, and I suddenly became overwhelmed with nostalgia.Desperate to regain my lost localness, I chose to ride busses to retrieve my most cherished memory of the city. Taking only one specific bus line would have been lackluster, so I adopted a bigger challenge: I took the first bus that arrived at the stop, then got off at the very next stop to catch the next bus that arrived, again and again until I completed the “100 Station Challenge”.After walking through villages with unfamiliar names and arriving at countless dead ends within a day, I realized that Beijing, the city that I claim to come from, had grown without me, developing new spotlights and welcoming new inhabitants, while leaving me behind as a stranger. At that moment, I felt that my hometown was disappointed in me for leaving, and thus revoked my “Beijinger” identity as punishment.“Do you ever feel you are excommunicated by Beijing?” I asked Chris, another former Beijinger now living in Hong Kong.“Nope.” Chris responded without hesitancy, “Beijing is not a church, and there is no membership.”He continued while I pondered my misused religious analogy, “It is a tattoo on one’s back, barely viewed by the person himself, but occupies the body for a lifetime.”Many of my childhood friends never left Beijing and probably never will. They took my road not taken and planted their roots deep into Beijing’s soil. But as for many citizens like Chris and me, uprooting, transplanting, and readapting bestowed upon us its serendipities. We were no excommunicates—leaving home for another place was not a sin and personally speaking, it has been a blessing.Public transportation challenge series, which started from a hundred bus rides, was that amazing blessing. It revealed to me a unique way of immersing into different cities. In Hong Kong, I picked up both the notoriously difficult nine-toned dialect and high work efficiency; in Chengdu, I was taught to embrace life with passion while remaining composed at all times; in Rhode Island, I learned about New England heritage and the preppy dressing style on-site. None of the places I have lived in have failed to bequeath to me its idiosyncratic culture.Whether from trips on trains, subways, or buses, I invented an eclectic way of life of my own. Unlike my peers, I might have left my hometown too soon. But away from Beijing, my transportation challenges proved that though the road I took is less traveled by, it is as just as fair. As long as my trips continue to push me to new limits of understanding, Beijing’s influence on me will not vanish. Meanwhile, these different “homes” all taught me to view my next stop with hope, wherever that destination might be.“Please mind the gap between the train and the platform.” The announcement paused. I finished editing the photos on the platform soon after. In a few minutes, I would post these selfies online and a lot of acquaintances would see the post. My heart rejoiced because I can share with them my journey of epiphany.",
    "Supps": "题目：Vestigiality refers to genetically determined structures or attributes that have apparently lost most or all of their ancestral function, but have been retained during the process of evolution. In humans, for instance, the appendix is thought to be a vestigial structure. Describe something vestigial (real or imagined) and provide an explanation for its existence. -Inspired by Tiffany Kim, Class of 2020\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Three centuries after the first millennium in Anno Domini, an acolyte Adso left a manuscript on the scriptorium desk of the most splendid monastery in Northern Italy. In that elegantly rubricated manuscript, which later generations called The Name of the Rose, Adso recorded the flourishing monastic order under the Rule of Saint Benedict.Some great monasteries had incredible amount of power: They owned farms with tenants, traded with merchants for the finest goods, and were the most influential voices in society. They were the custodians of knowledge, the guardian angels of tradition, and harbingers of technology. It was the heyday of monasteries.Almost one thousand years later, the Portsmouth Abbey, a Benedictine monastery on Aquidneck Island (i.e. Isle of Peace in Wampanoag), still tolls the bell for compline every evening. And the monks, some of whom octogenarians, still follow the ancient Horarium. However, they compromise with an abridged liturgical schedule, or else only two hours of each day would not be involved with the Lectio Divina, the divine readings. And since a main portion of modern monasteries like Portsmouth Abbey has to include a school to survive, the lack of time would be fatal for those teaching monks.Besides living under religious vows, monks today are inherently different from their ancient counterparts. With just a few of them left, monks no longer make wines nor spend much time tending to illuminated manuscripts, instead aiding the homeless and the sick. Some skeptics might think that Catholic monks start their priesthood because they tend to romanticize it, chasing phantoms of the past, or even worse—they want to be taken care of.However, Father Paschal, an amiable teaching monk (the Funky Monk, as we call him) at Portsmouth Abbey School, has assured us that faith is the reason why monasteries still exist. He was an agnostic his entire life until his first mystic experience in a library. That moment was, directly quoting from him, “better than sex”. From that blissful moment, Father Paschal was able to give up the right to have properties, vacations, and a family. Every time he talks about that day with his students, his beard moves back and forth quite quickly from excitement.In retrospect, Father Paschal can still see the pious faces of his fellow priests who have passed away, the rare books in the Abbey sold for financial reasons, and of course, that moment of illumination. The monastic order may have outlived its peak and the monks are merely holding the rose’s name. Theymay be considered as figures of yesterday, but their reverence of God coalesces the monasteries of today. They still hold masses, promoting and giving thanks to Jesus’ forgiveness of sins regardless of time. One of the rituals that they kept from the olden days is the Gregorian chant (vocal lines in Latin), through the singing of which they beg for Christ’s mercy, on the people and on the monastery:“Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis...”(“Lamb of God, you who take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.”)\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：How does the University of Chicago, as you know it now, satisfy your desire for a particular kind of learning, community, and future? Please address with some specificity your own wishes and how they relate to UChicago.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Because of the ivies on the buildings of the main quad, because of the campus tour my tour guide Shree gave, and because of the most exciting prompts amongst colleges, the University of Chicago attracted me as a community. I would love to be a part of the school with diversity in all aspects, definite support of freedom and subsequently, its pedagogy.In high school, I took a class called “Faith and Church”. I walked into the classroom thinking I could learn about church history, but the teacher damned the use of contraceptives instead. In that “opinion-based” class, he referred to my opinion as “disrespectful”. Disappointed and disillusioned, I lost the passion to share my ideas in the class discussion.I felt like one of those UChicago students in 1947 who were persecuted under Broyle’s Bills, merely because they had ideas inconsistent with the tyrannical McCarthyism. In that case, UChicago proved to be a safeguard against indoctrination. Therefore at UChicago, I could finally form thoughtful opinions (e.g. contraceptives impact us positively) and try to defend them in seminars. In that encouraging learning environment, I will practice the school’s philosophy of “Audiatur et altera pars”: to listen even to the other side. And as a mutual intellectual exchange, the other side is going to listen to me.It is under the diversity and freedom of ideas that the art of learning is perfected at UChicago. Under the “New Plan”, the brainchild of Dean Chauncey Boucher, UChicago adopted the combination of the “Core” with other courses. I believe that with four years of liberal arts education at UChicago, I could take part in the dynamic academic conversation I listened to when I was an intern at Mogao Caves.I was following Professor Yu-min Lee from Graduate Institute of Art History in National Taiwan University and the Director of Dunhuang Academy into Cave 440, a cave of unidentified period and purposes. They discussed intensively about the carved lines on the lotus leaves on the columns. Seeing them got extremely serious about a seemingly trivial detail in an “insignificant cave”, I was drawn to the form of their conversation, a discussion focused on inquiry and debate (was that line added or original?), which UChicago’s active core classes are known for.Having seen so many statues and murals in anonymous caves, I wanted to speak on their behalf, as they could not voice for themselves. Missing their stories would be a huge loss because we would have fewer chances to find out the talents and beliefs of our ancestors. In my time at UChicago, I will be able to talk Michelangelo and Rembrandt with peers, and become insightful and eloquent in the language of art simultaneously.After I complete the Core curriculum, an 80-year-long broad-based conversation, I could join the art history professors’ conversation. Educated by UChicago in a comprehensive campus, I will pass on the passion for the caves, the appreciation of a small lotus leaf, into the hands of younger generations as how the professors passed it to me in the summer of 2016."

    "CommonApp": "During my first trip to Hong Kong, I indulged myself in a bookstore while my mother was crazily buying clothes from shop to shop. I have always been a fan of bookstores because I know, somewhere out there, I will come across a creative written piece that I am personally identified with.Wow! The Periodic Table of Heavy Rock! No sooner had I caught the first glimpse at that book, than I felt compelled to purchase it. On one hand, I am a science nerd who is willing to spend hours in the lab pouring one solution into another; on the other hand, I am a passionate rocker who yearns to relieve his power, shouting and screaming. How awesome is it to see someone I barely know integrating two major themes in my life into one commentary which could have been so technical and boring!The Periodic Table of Heavy Rock is indeed a fun book to read. The author matches each heavy rock band with an chemical element, justifying the “chemical properties” via substantial references to the musical masterpieces of that particular band. As a science nerd, I appreciate the elegance when chemistry language becomes an analogy to effectively express the hidden message. The structure of periodic table helps to explore the historical arguments between different styles and genres beneath the superficial description for bands. I bet, people with little exposure to chemistry might not thoroughly see how each part of “the periodic table of heavy rock” is inter-connected and thus suits the purpose of communication. As a passionate rocker, I cherish the sense of belonging that book brings to me. Flipping through pages, there are so many names and songs that I can recognize. I could still recall those hard times when my peers were all gossiping about popular singers like Taylor Swift, and all that I could do was to stare at them and barely say a word. In a sense, rock music is my second home, a palace where everything is familiar and pleasant.In addition to all these sentiments, interests also guide me to learn beyond the classroom. Believe it or not, when I want to kill some time, a random search on topics like Nirvana can be the first thing I go for. As I am exposed to multiple perspectives, my own arguments are gradually established. It was one of my proudest moment in the high school to stand in front of the history class, presenting the overnight flourish of Sex Pistols in the 1970s. Furthermore, the interest empowers me to hold on to the path of thorns. Having spent two weeks at Chinese Academy of Science, I am now able to confidently carry out some basic lab protocols, such as plasmid isolation and gel electrophoresis, techniques that I have previously read about rather than done. However, my first attempts at these practical skills were kind of awkward. At a laminar flow hood, there are plenty of chances to screw it up. However, for the precision of lab, contamination is not allowed. Anyway, I did make silly mistakes. Once, my instructor shouted at me because the bacterial culture was having a sweet little contact with the edge of my micro-pipette. I felt embarrassed when I had to start all over due to my lack of \"common sense\". Nonetheless, I tried my best to learn the scientific craftsmanship from loads of \"tedious\" repetitions. After all the successes and failures, I got to say, it is the interest that supports me through this “scary” journey, where I am the ignorant idiot to be laughed upon.In a nutshell, interests are the foundation for my whole personality. If I were not so much into chemistry and rock music, my life could be potentially altered.",

As a result, I would feel accomplished to become a rigorous scholar who generates new knowledge using fresh evidence with sincere endeavor. Meanwhile, I am also willing to dedicate my life to education, a career that passes on knowledge from generation to generation. Fortunately, my two ambitions are not mutually exclusive.Academically, I intended to apply for the honors program to investigate Chinese history. Despite the superficial exposure to historical knowledge in my high school syllabus, I am grateful that I have come across many compelling thematic issues in both contemporary and ancient China, such as early medieval China, nomadic empires, cultural revolutions etc. I understand that, deep down inside my blood, I am a Chinese person, and I desire to explore how the past constructs who I am. Therefore, in the past few years, I have read a huge array of books discussing different eras in China. The Red Rock tells me how the flourish and recession of Chinese rock music signified changes in the political climate in a narrotological approach, whereas On the Cusp between Wei and Jin Power and Networks during the Transition rigorously investigates how distinguished families of the Wei Empire gave rise to the shortly unified Jin Dynasty with substantial academic references. I am thrilled by the various angles how historical researches can be conducted.  ; ;Personally, I would like to do some tutoring work at the local community. Teaching has been my interests for years; it feels awesome to see my students overcome their obstacles and finally succeed. Up till now, I have done many tutoring jobs in my spare time, ranging from English for rural kids to Chemistry for my fellow peers. From these practical experiences, I am aware that teaching styles need to be adjusted based on the targeted audience. While colorful pictures are utilized to teach vocabulary for young kids, the syllabus-based approach is more suitable for my peers. There are so many types of students in the world; for each type, I need to develop specific methods in order to become a qualified teacher. In this sense, Macalester is the perfect platform for me to further develop my skills. During my college research, I get to know Nick McMullen, a current junior who has been volunteering at a local charter school as part of Educational Studies. Therefore, using the resources offered by Macalester, I can put my thoughts into practices and bring benefit to the local community.In conclusion, I will maximize my academic potential and take the advantage of existing resources. Ultimately, after I actually become a popular teacher in the near future, I hope I can look back and say that, it is Macalester that cultivates those essential qualities."

    "CommonApp": "Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.One day, when I descended toward the metro to get to primary school, my eyes were drawn toward a billboard of sparks flying out of a man’s mouth. It was a show in the Cirque du Soleil tour themed after a horror movie. I made sure to get tickets for its upcoming performance in Shanghai.At the time, my only expectation was to see a guy shooting sparks and embers out of his mouth like Charizard. However, there were unbelievable acrobatics as well as magic tricks beyond my young imagination. Specifically there was the ‘Globe of Death’ with 7 motorbikes in a steel cage ball. I held my breath until the last motorcycle was safely at the bottom of the cage.What I saw was totally impossible for me to understand. How did they reach the top of the inside of a steel ball without falling down? And how did they steer their motorbikes accurately in pre-calculated angles so that they will not bump into each other?Later on I was asked by my tutor, “What do you want to do when you grow up?” I said, “I want to join the circus,” with an odd determination. To put my ambition into practice, I started with basic techniques and worked up accordingly with risk and difficulty level.Juggling was the first step I took. It looked simple but required practice. The next step was a leap though: Every morning, I woke up with my unicycle beside me. Every day, while gleefully riding on my unicycle, I felt myself moving closer and closer to my dream of being a female motorcyclist.At first, my parents were amused by what they thought was just another kid exploring her curiosity. They assumed I would get bored by the frustrating and arduous practice necessary to master these skills. But when they found out how committed I was starting to become about riding a motorcycle upside down in a steel cage, they almost begged me to stop spending time on such dangerous pursuits.Unfortunately for me, everything changed after entering middle school. I could no longer focus on my circus skills with my diminishing leisure time. Yet it seemed like the only thing I could still be excited about…until one day, my physics teachers taught us about centripetal force. The mystery on the Globe of Death peeled off: that was the force keeping the motorcycle's tires stuck to the walls of the sphere.As the secrets of circus were exposed, the acrobatics I had regarded as magic and supernatural were no longer as glamorous as before, in my mind. It was so easily explained by science and suddenly removed from an invisible pedestal. What’s worse was that it was boiled down to easy-to-understand concepts. As the perfect impression was crushed, I did experience a period of disappointment. I could hardly abandon my unicycle.I pushed myself to think about the relationship between circus and science. There should not be a winner or a loser. I questioned myself: was an act itself intriguing me or the science behind how it happened. My answer was: both. I enjoyed doing circus skills myself as well as exploring the hidden mysteries. And of course, a circus is only a small application of science. But it drew me into a broader world abound with mysteries.Now, I dream of donning a lab coat instead, but I’m still thankful that the imagination and wonderment of the circus helped me find what I am truly passionate about. Dreams can mature from fantasies: And I still ride my unicycle, the cradle of dreams.",

As a teenager, I would suggest it to my peers at a time in our lives when everything seems too black and white: school is hard, life seems complicated, and the value of simplicity is overlooked. I believe this story is exactly how to explain that less can become more.Through the colors he used to depict this town, I find that Shen’s pure love and enthusiasm towards nature are directly conveyed. He makes full use of the clarity of water as the background and colors without breaking harmony or peace. Through words, he preserves natural beauty he perceived during childhood, and sought solace in during warfare. ;Also, the context of The Border Town shows Congwen’s simple sympathy towards a minority called the Miao who practiced a determined will against any form of violence. Different from the remarkable works constructed on troubled times, it is prudently set in the two years after a monumental revolution in 1911. Only within the peaceful and serene town could the Miao characters could grow up in an idyllic and natural state: No more massacres or poor children carrying heads chopped by soldiers. No one caused the tragedy. But why did it happen? ;I came to see beauty within sorrow. It is letting nature take its course. It is life: we break down and meet up again…just like the moon’s reflection dims or shines, waxes or wanes upon the town’s waters. ;The significance eluded me because it was obvious. After reading this book, I realized that even though Shen wrote the story in a simple way, it doesn’t mean that the lives of people are simple. And this extends to the good and the bad. Understanding that, makes it all the more digestible.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What have you done to challenge or change that which outrages you?

They were not only wasting crafting resources but also spoiling artistic potential. ;I asked them why they abused these materials. ‘But, they are trash,’ they said. I responded, ‘Oh really? What if I told you that in 5 minutes, it could become a purse?’I selected a large piece of cloth with a unique dye. After drawing a design graph directly on the back of the cloth, I fixed the parts that needed to be attached to each other with staplers and a glue gun. Turning the cloth inside out, I completed this simple but stylish purse. ;And thus, I converted the first members of my Eco-Crafting club.

I was curious about how this technology could address similar or greater problems that other people deal with.So, I investigated the effect of light wavelengths on a substitution reaction as my chemistry internal assessment. This typical reaction shows a strong tendency: fastest under 460 nm wavelength (blue light), and slowest under 725 nm wavelength (red light).But through that practical, I still had difficulties relating wavelengths to human physiological reactions. Therefore, in WFU, I would like to participate in undergraduate research to deeply explore more human-related reactions.

Yet, when I type ‘wireless history timeline’ in Google, the first step noted was how Guglielmo Marconi develops the first wireless telegraph. Maxwell, to me, is undoubtedly the Father of Wireless. ;Although he is known by the public for the complicated Maxwell’s equations, his influence in facilitating the practical use of wireless facilities is underestimated. Even in Ivan Tolstoy’s biography of Maxwell it is stated that: “His importance in the history of scientific thought is comparable to Einstein’s (whom he inspired) and to Newton’s (whose influence he curtailed)”. ;I too, thought it was interesting to suggest that important figures of the past may have gotten by with less to show for it.

Indeed, with special decorations, unlimited food and coffee, and activities like battling zombies, I am sure that I can stay pumped about studying.But I look forward to learning beyond books also: The two greenhouses and animal facilities nearby Winston Hall may allow me to connect nature to human physiology. Some issues within our bodies are solved naturally, like how beetroot juice affects blood flow as discovered by professor Daniel Kim-Shapiro in WFU. Outside, I can find not only to scientific inspiration, but also amazing hiking experiences. I want to learn survival skills by Belews Lake or in Hanging Rock State Park. I like working outside and I’m glad that’s a theme at WFU, where I’m sure I’ll have great success connecting nature and science."

    "CommonApp": "“Quitting vigorous exercises because of dysmenorrhea is nothing embarrassing,” said my doctor.I believed it firmly till I asked the academic principal, Mr. Dawson, for his permission to skip a PE lesson, “It’s ...girl’s problem, sir.”Mr. Dawson picked his icy eyebrow, “Fine. I spare you for the PE,” words came out from his thin lips, “and for the whole day. Leave school now!”“But, sir...”“Now, leave!” His voice sounded cold, with unquestionable authority.A sense of grievance poured into my chest, and my eyes were full of tears. But, I dared not to argue. I did not want to end up worse like my classmate who had been suspended two days’ lessons after challenging Mr. Dawson’s rules of managing student activities.When I explained to Ms. Jessica, our administrative director, why I had to request for an early leaving, she comforted me, “Don’t worry. I will talk to Mr. Dawson.” I saw a glimmer of hope from that - Mr. Dawson might change his mind if Ms. Jessica stood up for me; if not, I would not be blamed at least. I accepted Ms. Jessica’s help without hesitation.   Mr. Dawson said nothing when I met him at noon. I delightedly assumed that he had been persuaded to take his order back. However, he came to me before the Geography class, with the leaving request, “Sign the paper, and don’t let me kick you out.”Mr. Dawson commanded every student to follow his directions under any circumstance, and I was no exception.I walked down along the hallway to Ms. Jessica’s office, with useless tears. Curling up in a corner, I waited for my mother to pick me up. Somehow, I remembered that I used to curl up in a corner of my mother’s closet when she was about to leave for Suzhou and I dared not to ask her to stay or take me along. I only held her clothes and cried myself to sleep, hoping that mum would come back home on her own, as I hoped Ms. Jessica could solve the problem for me. I had never changed in the course of years.I questioned myself, “Why did I always count on someone else to save me from my dilemma? What if I stand out for my own and get what I want?” I couldn’t help thinking if I could have talked to Mr. Dawson by myself, I might still need to go back home, but I could walk out by myself instead of being kicked out in such an embarrassing way. It was at that moment I realized I must step out from my safety zone and endeavour to do everything on my own.I recalled that day a lot - the tears I dropped on the playground, along the hallway, and in the administrative office, and how timid I used to be. I reminded myself to make changes, so I did. I came to the Ms. Sara for her advice during office hours on my additional analytical papers and college choices instead of just getting A in US History and walking out of the classroom soon after the bell rang; I struggled for another chance of interview when I was informed the Inscribed Steels Museum only recruited adult volunteers, and I won the position due to my touching passion; I ran for the student leadership and was determined to take over the cooking club when the initial founder graduated this May...Though sometimes I still hesitate, I am more willing to push myself forward and fight for my own, and that is a great progress.The girl hiding and crying in her mother’s closet will never come back, neither will the girl with tears wishing others to strive for her stay. I guarantee that.",
    "Supps": "题目：Richmond values not only the students' academic potentials but also their responsibilities for the real society. Describe a recent story or event that has impacted you most and feel free to share us your views and thoughts and how they are related to Richmond.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          “Orlando nightclub massacre: Deadly shooting at Pulse gay bar.”“Breaking news from Orlando, Florida...”Almost all the mainstream media posted the news of the gay bar attack in Orlando, with different headlines but the same shocking tones, in the afternoon on June 13, 2016. I could not help noticing the news as they kept popping out one by one.Homophobia was said to be a main reason for Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, the gunman, to commit such a crime. As I clicked my mouse and saw the cruel pictures of the crime scene, I questioned, “How could someone kill and injure near one hundred innocent people just because of homophobia? If homophobia could be a good reason for the crime, what about other severe social problems such as racial discrimination, religious discrimination, political conflicts, etc? How much bloodshed will be costed until people realize violence is not a good way to solve social problems?”Lost in great grief, I couldn’t help thinking that putting up nonviolent resistance may be a better way to pursue social changes as well as maintaining peace. Howard Zinn engaged in the civil rights movement by teaching black students at Spellman College; Martin Luther King and Malcom X fought for racial equality by making speeches and writing articles. Their nonviolent resistance contributed to the end of segregation and improved racial equality. In contrast, some African Americans protested violently for the shooting of African Americans by white policemen and caused injury of ordinary people and the police. Their violent protest didn’t help solving racial problems; instead, it triggered more hatred between races and worsened their relationship which was already intense.Behind most violent mayhems are resentful people who find no better way to present their opinions other than hurting others. If there could be a course that teaches people how to solve injustices in a civilized manner and how to make the world hear their aspirations in a harmless but powerful way, they would take relatively peaceful actions when they have strong opinions about some problems. Supposing the gunman who caused the mass shooting in Orlando ever had a chance to learn about how to express his opinion toward homosexuality in a moderate way, the tragedy might have never happened.Should I have the chance to be a part in University of Richmond, I wonder whether I could make a proposal to the academics committee to open a course regarding nonviolent resistance. Associated with the mission of University of Richmond, the course could lay stress on teaching students to pursue social reformations, be responsible for their community and the whole society, and stand mighty for peace. Besides, as nonviolent resistance is a subject closely connected to social issues, it could help Richmond students to become future social activists, pacifists, and global leaders."

    "CommonApp": "My mum is no good at cooking. She puts sugar instead of salt in chicken soup, boils vegetables into a mush and the best dish she makes is instant noodle. There have been so many mistakes in the kitchen that I even could not remember them all.When I was young, my father took charge of cooking. But following my parent’s separation, not only did my mum have to work, but she also had to learn cooking. I saw immediately that this was challenging and unnatural for her, and I began to worry. Not only were we not eating well, but mum was obviously exhausted from work. So, after hundred times of failure, I finally said to her, “Don’t worry. I will learn to cook.”My first time cooking, I was barely as tall as the counter, and it was difficult in the beginning. The first dish I attempted was a fruit salad. Unfortunately, I made it using unwashed fruits, and accidently made my mother sick. My first time stir-frying vegetables was equally unsuccessful, and I was burned by the splattering hot oil. But after thousand times failure, I began to improve. I learned to make sweet and sour pork, my mum’s hometown dish. When she ate it, I could see that it released her homesickness and comforted her. Soon, I learnt more recipes so that I could take better care of mum.As I continued cooking, not only did I grow into a decent chef, but I saw our family relationship change. Prior to my parent’s separation, I was used to seeing traditional families: fathers or mothers need to work and take care of the elderly and the young. For children, the task is basically to be taken care of. Following my parents’ separation, however, I saw these roles didn’t make sense in our situation. Instead of hiding under the protection of my parents, I needed to care for them. I admit, at first I didn’t like this new burden. The kitchen was hot, and cooking was difficult. However, from cooking reluctantly and complaining, I slowly began to enjoy it. I liked receiving positive feedback from my tasty dishes. But my greatest sense of accomplishment didn’t come from compliments. After I took on the role, mum seemed more energetic and relieved of stress. Seeing her this way, I felt proud to accept this special family responsibility, even if it’s slightly different than others. Cooking was a gift, and I was glad to share it with mum.More personally, cooking helped my family to rebuild our relationships and gave me the insight and maturity to adapt from this change in my family. When they first divorced, I felt like a girl who forgot my way home. What would our family look like? Would may parents still love me? Cooking helped ease those fears. Each night, we’d sit down and eat together the meal I prepared, and this was my way to bring stability back to our household, building a bridge between us for communicating and expressing love. I’ve heard many people say single parent family means that the kid must lives in a broken family, but those meals I share with mum showed me we were not broken at all. My family might look a little different, but we are loving and united.As time goes on, my family continues to change. I’ve moved away to boarding school, where I live alone in an apartment near campus. Meanwhile, mum moved to Zhuhai for work, but visits every other weekend, and when she’s here, I still make sure to cook for her. This simple act is not only a bond of love between us. It has helped me redefine my family and find my place in it, offering me an opportunity to become a mature, responsible adult and contributor to my precious family, one dish at a time.",

One way to improve sustainability is organic farming. However, because of high cost and misconceptions about safety, it is hard to spread organic food in China.In senior two, I attended China Thinks Big, a research and innovation contest. During the competition, my group presented research on the current state of organic farms and customers’ opinions of organic food. To educate citizens about the process and advantages of organic planting, we also created an activity called vegetable diary, where we encouraged citizens to grow their own soybean plants.Although the competition is over, I’ve continued to fight for sustainability by giving out articles on Wechat. I hope this can help spread organic concepts and protect our environment.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Communities Essay\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Shenzhen Middle School, where I’ve lived and spent the last three years studying is regarded as the most democratic school in Shenzhen, or even in China. We have both central Student Union and committees elected from every class to discuss school rules, and almost all non-class activities are planned and led by students. With such great freedom comes responsibility, and when problems arise, it is students who need to stand up and address them instead of waiting for the administration.I am a member of Student Union equity department, a student group tasked with addressing student grievances. As such, I act as liaison between students and administration to find solutions to problems like the rise in price of cafeteria food or allowing use of cell phones outside class. Generally, we solve these problems ourselves, or for bigger problems, we conduct panels between directors and students to work together to find solutions. Before my experience in Equity Department, I even did not notice there were so many problems in our school, but within the first year, I gradually cultivated the habit of noticing latent problems and moved from passively accepting problems to actively changing them.The democratic atmosphere of our school helps me become a student who raise questions actively and fights for solutions immediately instead of sitting and waiting. I’ve not only become a proactive and determined problem- solver, but also I gain further understanding to justice and equality, fighting for the rights in other situations.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Why that College or School?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Architecture has long had a place in my life. As the daughter of two architects, I received introductions from my parents about buildings from a young age. I distinctly remembered a trip to Washington, where they introduced the strange, unique Seattle Library to me. With its abnormal shape, I couldn’t help but wonder, “Why did architects design it this way?”Throughout high school, I’ve had many opportunities to begin answering this question and learning how to think like an architect. For example, in grade 10, I participated in a mathematics modeling competition, HiMCM, where our group was tasked to find a solution to a traffic problem. As we combined math, physics, and design to solve the problem, I felt inspired seeing how design could be employed to solve social problems and knew architecture and urban planning were something I wanted to continue to explore.Thus, last summer I enrolled in an architecture career discovery course at University of Hong Kong. My mornings at HKU started with workshops and lectures, where we learned architecture concepts, landscape design, urban planning, preservation and conservation. Afternoons were filled by studios, where we designed our own projects based on given assignment. The program helped solidify my goal to study architecture in university.I hope to continue my architecture journey at University of Michigan Taubman College. Taubman’s academic approach is diverse and cross-disciplinary, offering architecture, urban design and urban planning fields of study and providing a curriculum that emphasizes the change architects and urban designers can bring to positively change the world. Taubman’s facilities are particularly impressive. Besides the beautiful, newly renovated building, Taubman also provides many rare, high-tech features, such as the specialty Digital fabrication lab. These industrial technologies will introduce me to state-of-the art tools and make me familiar with the most recent advances in architecture.Outside of the classroom, Taubman provides many opportunities for students to experience architecture and explore personal interests. As a research institution, University of Michigan provides opportunities like the Architecture Student Research Grant that allows students to explore their creativity and start making a difference even as an undergraduate. Beyond campus, Taubman also provides many architecture-related study abroad opportunities. After reading previous students’ experiences about study abroad on Michigan’s website, this is an aspect of Taubman that is particularly exciting to me. Opportunities like Spring Travel Courses or summer half term travel will allow me to interact with architecture face-to-face, understanding the cultural and historical meanings of local architectures while engaging with local students and expert architects. For instance, visiting traditional Europe cities can allow me to further understanding architectural history, while traveling around modern cities gives me more inspiration on design.Lastly, Taubman’s extensive career services train students in job seeking strategy and help them accumulate experience in architecture, both before and after graduation. On-campus workshops, Career and Networking Fairs, and Spring Break Connections externship programs broaden my future career prospects and help me get closer to my goal of being a working architect."

    "CommonApp": "It was a typical family dinner to celebrate my uncle’s birthday. While the adults were busy cooking in the kitchen, I was going around and looking for John, my little cousin, whom I hadn’t seen in a while. In a small bedroom of my uncle’s home, I found John sitting there and doing his homework. My aunt, who I admired for her independence and dedication to her job as a banker, was sitting close to him to make sure he finished all of his homework. The scene was déjà vu. Growing up, my mother has always been very strict with my studying too. We used to argue all the time because she would not allow me to do anything but studying. When I wanted to learn singing, she said no because she worried it would take up my studying time. When I wanted to play badminton, she said no because I might get injury that causes me to skip school. When I was selected as the lead delegate for our school’s Model United Nation team, I had to sneak out of our home to go to practices because my mother believed those activities were meaningless. In her mind, going to college was the only way to have a good life. However, despite all the argument, I never blame my mother. When my mother and aunt were in elementary school during the Cultural Revolution, they were required to pick up firewood, cut grasses, and do farming work. They barely had enough time to read and study. In order to read, they had to use candles to light up the room at night. During the long winter in the north, their hands and feet were covered by chilblains after reading. To them, at a time that everyone was destined to be a farmer, studying was the only way for them to change their destiny. They put all of their spare time into studying, got into college, and became successful in life. As I grew up, I came to understand my mother’s belief and tried my best to comply, especially after my parents divorced. However, while I understand the importance of education, I believe time has changed and there is more than one way to learn and success means not just going to college and get a good job.Table tennis, one of the few things I was allowed to do by my mom during my spare time, taught me how to be persistent and patient when facing an obstacles. Model United Nation, something that I really enjoyed doing because of my interest in history and politics, taught me how to present my argument logically and objectively to convince the audience. My mom did not know about this, but I read a lot of web fiction during my spare time. I was fascinated by the utopian world these writers described and surprised to learn how talented successful these writers are. These none-studying learning experiences have helped me as much as studying. At first, my mother was skeptical. However, as time went by, she saw how much I grew up because of these activities that I did outside of studying and started to change her perception. I would always try my best in school and be the best student I could be. However, I needed my mother to know that learning can be done in various ways and it is not just what I learned in book, but in life, that matters. I enjoyed the time my mother spent watching me do homework because she taught me the importance of education. But I am about to go abroad for college, I need to let her know her daughter is a lifelong learner, who sees success with a broader definition and can learn from both inside and outside of the classroom.",

From a young age, her life was filled with hunger and poverty, which urge her to use education to change her life. Without qualified teachers and course content, she had to rely on her own for the most part. Such ability not only helped my mother in her study and career path, but also helped her to be persistent and strong.

Staying with her all day enabled me to inherit such spirit of exploration and persistent into my own life. ;From a young age, I started jump the rope jumping everyday to maintain my health.

After I grew a bit older, I learnt various jumps. I wound play the recording of some of my favorite films to distract my tiredness when jumping. I explored numerous methods to persist in exercising everyday. And now, I had persisted nearly eight years.The notable thing was not that I kept on exercise everyday for myself but my courage to fight for my spirit of exploration and insistent. These successes strengthen my courage and insistent and I hope such will could add to the diversity of the Brandeis University."

    "CommonApp": "The school bell rings on an ordinary Friday after lunch. The classes of the week ended, but the most enjoyable part of my day has just started.I walk into our band's practice room, seeing all kinds of instruments to compose beautiful music - two pianos along the wall, violins and drums in the back corners, my seat at the front of the room. Whenever I walk into the small practice room, it always feels like walking into a new world, with music and harmony filling the air. The pianos play a low sound, controlling the flow of the music. The violins take the lead at the high pitch, following the rhythm of the pianos. The drums highlight the rhythm, giving it emphasis. As for myself, I play the flute and my role is to accompany everyone and contribute to the harmony. I still remembered the time when we formed our small band. The different instruments, the different interests in musical styles, the individual egos; initially we could only produce a big cacophony, with no prominence or harmony. Thus, we quickly learned that there's no way our band would make it playing as individuals. We sat and talked, somebody had to take a step back. There was only one person who could take the lead, but everyone would still play a necessary part. Now, every musical instrument has its own place and function in our band, though the audience may not notice every contribution in our performances. Being a necessary part of this small band in our small practice room, I can really feel the power of music, the power we produce when we all cooperate with each other. After band time, school time is over. But for me, it is time to go on my weekly cycling trip. Being the leader of a group of cycling enthusiasts, it is my responsibility to organize all the trips, and this week, I planned for us to ride to the river bank, a place I have long been thinking about visiting. Before leaving, I made sure that the route was correct, the weather sunny, and the first-aid kit in my bag. Crossing the streets, feeling the road under my bike, I feel the freedom that I control everything. Arriving at the river bank, I ride along it, and I feel the wind passing by, blowing up my hair and clothes; it feels like the sensation of flying. Every riding trip is a new adventure. Riding on my bike, going to some place I have never been, seeing new sights and meeting new people. Sometimes, I stop and chat with people along my way. I love to hear their stories, and to tell them about our group’s past adventures. It is just what my adventuring spirit is about, going to new places, and meeting new people. After riding, I return home for a quick dinner and I set up my computer to open the chat group with my math modeling peers. In math modeling, I love the adventure of tackling new problems. I also love cooperating with my math modeling partners to build the best solutions to each unique problem. In our group, everyone has his or her own responsibility, from building the model like the lead soloist of a band, or writing the main structure of the report like the piano leading the flow of the tune. Some jobs may seem less important, but a comprehensive and insightful solution cannot be produced without the collective efforts of all of us. Maybe that's why I choose math modeling to be my interest and explore it in my spare time - it fulfils my adventurous and collaborative spirit. And that's what I would like to after graduation - use my knowledge in math modeling to contribute to important work in economics, healthcare, or the environment.",

Thus, Math just naturally became my perfect companion - an equation, a theory, a rule, math provides me a language to communicate abstract ideas and a methodology to understand the logic underlying coincidences and phenomena. And since grade 4, I’ve explored my interest in math theory by participating in individual and team math competitions. I have participated in AMC several times to further test my ability, and have scored in the top 1% several times. ;However, it wasn't until I was introduced to math modeling that I realized how I could apply what I learnt all those years and how I could use math to make the world a better place. Since, math modeling has occupied most of my spare time. Together with three of my modeling peers, we spend loads of time together, analyzing problems, building models, applying our solutions to all kinds of real life problems. ;Math modeling provides me with the chance to fulfill my adventurous and collaborative spirit and to contribute to important work in economics, healthcare, and the environment. Collaborating with my math modeling team, we have addressed many problems varying from Canadian Elk population growth to evaluating city safety rates, in which we developed a rating system based on crime data provided about a city in two weeks' time. With all the data we received, we were able to investigate the effect of foreign population, time periods of a day and different days of a week on city crimes rates, and also generated a rating system based on the different severity of crimes happening in the city. Through exploring math modeling, I have also developed an interests in computer science due to the utility of running simulations using Matlab. The knowledge in computer science really aids my research, and the rigorous logic in programming compels me to explore further.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          For two years, I have been the leader of the cycling club in our school, with about thirty members in the club, we have been the largest and most gender balanced sports club in school. Being the leader of this large group of people, it is my responsibility to plan for our cycling trip every week. ;During all these years of cycling, our team has traveled to places such as Thames Town, rural areas outside of Shanghai, and a memorable bike ride to Chong Ming Island, which lasted for three days Of course, a lot of preparation has to be done before the trip. Every week before starting the trip, I check and make sure that the route was correct, the weather sunny, and the first-aid kit in my bag.For me, crossing the streets, feeling the road under my bike, I feel the freedom that I control everything. Every time I ride along the road, feeling the wind passing by, blowing up my hair and clothes; it feels like the sensation of flying. Every riding trip is a new adventure. Riding on my bike, going to some place I have never been, seeing new sights and meeting new people. Sometimes, I stop and chat with people along my way. I love to hear their stories, and to tell them about our group’s past adventures. It is just what my adventuring spirit is about, going to new places, and meeting new people. ;Besides organizing the trips, I spend a lot of time propagating our club and cycling as a way of life. Every semester, I give speeches to attract new members to our club. When I started, there were only two girl members, but now two years later, we have become the largest sports club on campus with more than twenty members and half being female. ;I am very proud for all these changes in our school and the results of my hard work and effort.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Since I have been in the same school since primary school, I have looked for opportunities to give back. In grade 10, I joined the student union and ever since I have been working as the head of the secretariat department. However, the student union is not the place where people tell you how to do things directly—it is where we learn how to figure things out by ourselves.I still remember the first task I received. I was assigned to be in charge of the decorations of the whole school for Halloween with a budget given by the school that was definitely not enough. After days of thinking, I went to the art teachers in the school and set up a jack-o-lantern making competition to promote students' enthusiasm for the activities and to gather decorations. I also searched for old decorations from the past years, and with my peers we made some more with paper and ribbons. We spent hours and hours and finally all the work paid off. I was quite surprised what us students could accomplish together with a little ingenuity. ;After that, I continued to receive all kinds of different activity organizing tasks to do, from designing the sports competition for the school, which involves students from grade 7 to grade 12, and different activities were designed for different grades. There were fun and simple activities such as \"Simon says\" and more cooperative activities such as dodge ball. Besides, I even took part in the school's annual charity performance by working backstage and organizing the microphones. ;These experiences have enhanced my ability to organize activities, to take up responsibility, and to adjust to changing circumstances and challenges. Through helping my school community in the student union, the experience has come to define a great part of me.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          For years, I have been greatly interested in music - and this led to my decision to learn the flute in middle school. Since then, I practice my flute for more than half an hour each day. Then, I started to perform solos during small school concerts, but began to yearn to play in a band with different instruments and peers to collaborate with.In high school, I finally had the chance to start a band with my peers. I quite enjoy being in our small practice room, with two pianos along the wall, violins and drums in the back corner, my seat at the front of the room. Being a band with most of the instruments for classical music, we started practicing classical music pieces such as Pachelbel's Canon.But as time passed and we became more and more fluent playing music, we wanted to do more. We decided to explore the culture difference between Chinese traditional music and Western classical music by using by playing Chinese traditional tunes with our classical instruments to converge and highlight differences between the two kinds of music. I was excited our band had the chance to be invited to a performance called Clash Of Culture, where we found a lot peers with the same thoughts as us. I still remember that day on the stage. The pianos playing a low sound, controlling the flow of the music. The violins took the lead at the high pitch, the drums highlighting the rhythm, giving it emphasis. As for myself, my role is to accompany everyone with my flute and to contribute to the harmony. It was not the same as the feeling of traditional music - the sound we produce is more bright and hard, but still fluent and nice.After that, we have continued this kind of exploration on more kinds of music, such as modern music, in which we use classical instruments to play the popular Billboard songs. Through this experience, it improves my ability to step outside the norm and create new things."

    "CommonApp": "“I think wires are too rigid, so they should not be considered for weaving together to make a frame.” “Glue sticks are not as strong as super glue, so let’s discard them.” “Are you sure you need beads and feathers to decorate a poster?”When I was designing a three-dimensional poster in the art classroom, my friends would occasionally give me these kind pieces of advice as they passed by. My friends’ words were constant reminders that there are defined limits for all materials. But secretly, I love thinking about things in a “perfected form” and then listing what is required to achieve it, not just for the materials required to achieve perfection in arts or sciences, but also for people.Because of my good performances in Math and the sciences, I was praised as a “good material for scientist,” which is the literal translation from Chinese slang. However, still curious about my own potential, I decided to drop one chemistry project to make more time to create News Expresso: the not-yet-existing student online media that would become an alternative for the rigid content and dry language of our official school magazine. Having curved a wire to make the stand for my three dimensional poster and having melted glue sticks to add feathers for decoration, the “good scientist material” found some courage to start a new form of school media. After I found myself reading the same sentence over and over again in our school’s newspaper and still failing to digest its meaning, I knew it was time to try for myself.I am not the best editor, but I am skilled at gathering talented people who are. Thanks to all of my lab experience, I am used to creating a defined set of procedures and breaking it down into detailed working plans for every member. However, just like wires alone cannot make a stable structure, I needed to find my “glue.”Candice’s name was the first, and best, to pop up in my mind. She is an “endangered” newspaper-reading species in the 21st century. She is someone who still reads the school news several times a day and also would rather skip a meal than put down an exciting new book. Candice is like my glue stick, holding together areas where my deficiencies make it hard to do it. It is possible for us to support the whole club.  “Are you sure that I can be the head editor?” She asked hesitantly. A shy girl with abundant emotions hidden under a peaceful smile, Candice has a kaleidoscopic inner world which is only open to me. Can a shy person lead a team?  Possibly. Can a shy writer create a magazine with an extroverted science student? Probably. I persuaded her to give it a shot.The chance I created for us was like adding heat to a glue stick, changing the material from a solid form to a liquid. Gradually she melded into the form of someone who is much more comfortable with communication. And with her meticulous editing and useful insights, I was finally able to produce acceptable articles on my own. What we couldn’t achieve alone, we achieved together by helping each other become more versatile “materials.”“Would you like to help run the online school official newspaper this year?” An email from school headmaster read. Candice finished her cup of coffee and mentioned the name Joe. “It seems we need a programmer now.” I immediately dialed Joe, the computer science genius. While wires and glue stick could make impressive artwork, feathers, beads, and other decorations could make it truly stand out. “I know nothing about managing the backend of a subscription account, do you think that I can...” Joe’s voice was full of uncertainty.“Yes, let’s try!” Candice whispered behind me and I repeated her words into the phone.",
    "Supps": "题目：Why are you drawn to studying the major you have selected? Please discuss how your interests and related experiences have influenced your choice. Specifically, how will an education from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) and Cornell University help you achieve your academic goals? (Please limit your response to 650 words.)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I select food science as my major without much hesitation. Being a foodie and recognized as top student in my science class, I have always been curious about how to make food tasty and healthy by applying science. It is part of my life.I love fresh figs, but couldn’t help noticing that many times they are easily spoiled by improper packing. Therefore, I designed a ventilating box to transport fruits in bulk while maintaining their freshness after comparing different preservation methods.Conversations in family kitchen also inspired me to do my own research on food science. Recently my father, a well-educated person, stopped me from eating my favorite pickles because he just read an online article titled “Nitrite is More Poisonous than Arsenic” and was made to believe that pickles are rich with nitrite. Feeling curious, I decided to test and measure the nitrite level in pickles, fresh vegetable and leftovers by myself. I compared my data with the maximum nitrite level intake recommended by our National Food Safety Foundation, and reached a conclusion that we could continue eating pickles but better throw away leftovers. And this makes me realize the gap between science and daily life. Although it is true that lots of food safety journal and articles are published and released every year, average people do not read them because they were specifically written for scientists and professionals. I’m hoping to present these scientific results via animations so that more people can get to know this information. As a Chinese saying goes, “Food is heaven to people,” which could be interpreted as “Food is the most enjoyable thing to people.” I want to do my part to ensure food safety and help people to enjoy their food more.Before researching CALS, I was worried that the academic major I would select might be too specific for most undergraduate programs in the United States. The sentence “CALS selects students who are ready to dive into their major as soon as they set foot on campus” on CALS website immediately eased my worries with the excitement to apply. As a hands-on student who enjoys lab work more than anything else, CALS provides the best undergraduate research opportunity in the states. As someone who is not satisfied with just observing the experiment results, but loves communicating scientific conclusions to others, I think CALS totally aligns with my interest since it values Knowledge with Pubic Purpose. Also, during my school research, I am excited to learn about the research area associate professor Dr. Gavin Sacks focuses on, effects of pre- and post-harvest factors on the organoleptic properties of agricultural products, particularly wines and juices. What a coincidence! Two of my favorite foods are fruits and pickled vegetables. Fruit is the basic ingredient for wines and juices, and both pickled vegetable and wines have to go through the process of fermentation. Since Dr. Sacks is regular participant at winemaking workshops and industry technical conferences, I believe his class will be filled with real life experience and fun!I am very clear about my academic interest and believe CALS is a perfect match to provide the exact research opportunity and educational resource I need to explore food science."

    "CommonApp": "Jumping jacks, high knees, and stretching, I carefully followed the instruction shown on my cellphone. I took a look at my previous record, took a deep breath, and told myself today was the day I shall break my record for twelve kilometers (fifty-five minutes). I started running five years ago with no coach, no stamina, and not even a pair of running shoes. Since running was such a basic human movement, I thought if I carefully controlled my speed, I could run for half an hour. I could not be more wrong. Within 5 minutes, I was totally out of breath.The only thing that propelled me to keep moving my feet was my fear of being unhealthy and overweight, the way I had been throughout middle school. When I first started, I was an overweight kid who could lie on the sofa playing with my iPad without even moving a little for the whole day. I was so lazy that I rely on take-out for a whole week and would need to Uber just to get to the Burger King five minutes away. To be honest, I chose to run because it was the only sport I knew how to do. It wasn’t until much later I realized only few could really master running. For the first several months, every piece of my body hurt when I ran. It was not just my feet, ankles, and knees, but also my arms, back, and even stomach. Running under the sun during the summer was like hell to me. To spare the pain of running, I would think of the most ridiculous reason not to run (rain, wet path, no cold beverage at home, etc.). But I knew if I skip once, I would fall back into the old me that I was so desperate to run away from. I kept running. After more than six months, I could felt the changes inside of me. Pants became loosen. I even need a belt. Potato chips and instant noodles were gone. A lot of green had entered my diet. No more Pepsi or bubble milk tea, just water. Running made me felt more energetic. I was able to concentrate better in school and my grades were improving. I even tried out badminton and soccer, those intensive sports I never dare to try. Everyone can run, but only few can master it. Through continuous training, a runner is making small improvement day by day, week by week, and month by month. None of the improvement is obvious and inspiring. But as long as I stay patient and determined, all my hard work would add up to create fundamental changes. Running not only made me healthier and more outgoing, it also taught me to be patient and trust the all my hard work would pay off. Because of my passion towards debating, I have the tendency to speak really fast. My friends and families were often impressed by how fast I could speak, but often confused about what I was saying. It takes a habit to break a habit. Reading newspaper slowly and out loud became my new nightly habit. I also recorded all of my presentation and debating, trying to fight out where I could improve to make myself clearer. Just like being lazy, speaking too fast takes a lot of time to correct. But as long as I am a little bit better than I was yesterday, I believe I would eventually correct my habit. “12 KM complete. Congratulations.” my cell phone application announced. I checked the time: fifty-four minutes fifty-nine second. I smile, knowing that I have improved just a little again.",

Technology allowed me to present colors smoothly and shapes seamlessly. ;The twenty days I spent over the summer at the ESAP Computer Graphic program in University of Pennsylvania revolutionized my understanding of design and technology in a 3D level. Before the program, I could never imagine that starting on a simple 3D cube in Maya, I could create realistic characters with scaring alien-like tentacles, numerous protruding fierce teeth, and realistic chest muscle just like the Na’vi people in Avatar and then efficiently present it on motion graphic. ;In the Tandon School of Engineering, I hope to continue to explore at the combination of art and technology through Integrated Digital Media major. ;Fundamental courses such as Creative Coding and Mobile Application Development can teach me the basic computer coding skills to create interactive user experience and present my work in multiplatform such as web and mobile application. In addition, technique-based courses such as 3D Animation and Digital Photography and Imaging will allow me to enhance 3D modeling skill in Maya and photography skills in aid to create special effect with green screen.Game Design and Development are a perfect stage for me to apply learned knowledge in a step-by-step process. From brainstorming plots to creating characters’ surface texture, I can collaborate with computer technology in a much more intimate way. In the experimental game narratives courses, I can learn to design a truly interactive game experience with not only realistic graphics and attractive plot. ;In addition, NYU’s study aboard programs will allow me to learn about arts and design in places other than New York. The urban design program in London gives me the opportunity to explore designing accurate 3D visualization software to make urban planning more efficient and architectural heritage preservation more easily. The study abroad programs in Paris enriches my experience of video editing, recording ability, and documentary production to present the beautiful global food culture in the form of lights and sounds. ;At NYU, not only I can improve my programming and designing skills, but also I will gain the opportunity to explore New York, London, and Paris to truly study arts and design. ;"

    "CommonApp": "When I was in elementary school, I was obsessed with a video game called Ballance, a game that requires its player to navigate a ball through various obstacles to reach the destination. Unfortunately, I was not a talented gamer and got stuck by this one stage. Curious about the next stage, I went on the Internet to search for a strategy. While I was not able to find any, I discover a way to “cheat” with a binary text editor. I decrypted the game’s kernel files and edited some hexadecimal digits. As a result, I was able to alter the game’s gravity, the ball’s velocity and weight. It was the first time I realized the magic of finding a shortcut. By changing the rules of the game to my advantage, I was able not only get through the game but also understand how the game was designed.Fortunately for me (not so for my parents), I became a better gamer in junior school. Through the power ofthe internet, I was able to play the game Minecraft with players from all over the world. With several other enthusiastic gamers, we dissected the game and learned how data was processed and stored. With several hundred lines of code, we made it more interesting by allowing more possibilities. We even set up our own server for this alternative version of Minecraft that we designed.Computer games were not the only thing I applied my shortcut-finding skill at. After taking computer science courses in high school, I learned to apply a few lines of codes to replace routine work. With the help of merging sort (a type of sorting algorithm), I was able to rearrange seats randomly with three premises, saving my classmates a lot of time from doing it manually. With the help Java and my understanding of the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve, I could generate a review plan to help me memorize vocabularies. Using simple C# language, I helped my teacher to reprogram a downloading software to double its speed.Many believe that finding a shortcut is unethical and that we should not look for shortcuts in life. What they do not understand is that finding a shortcut is not being lazy. In fact, most of the time, it requires a lot of dedication. Observing the existing pattern and understanding the logic behind it are usually the first step. For each subsection of a problem, we think about what to do in each particular condition, creating an “if” statement. Then we consider which part needs to be operated constantly, creating a “loop”. And at least, think about what to do with an exception. Debugging is essentially a continuous process of experimenting, where we keep building and fixing. Only after countless trials and fixing, a shortcut entrenched. Over time, shortcuts no longer work or need to be improved, and we start the process all over again. But this is the beauty of finding a shortcut: observation, innovation, refinement, and perfection.Instead of settling for “the method that usually works”, I would look for “the method that works better”. Having the curiosity to find shortcuts has allowed me to think outside of the box and to try things that others might see as impossible. Whenever I face a problem, I would put myself in the mind of a shortcut developer, trying to come up with a creative solution. While many might argue that shortcut is the same as cheating, I would argue that shortcut is a way to innovate.",

Just like the title of our textbook,\n“Psychology and Life,” psychology explains many situations in life.

I was fascinated by\n“Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman. I learned to analyze various situations using statistical reasoning\ninstead of sometimes-misleading heuristics. For example, I taught my parents not to waver their preference on\ntraveling by airplanes because of a recent accident they saw in the news. They made the judgment by emotion\nand ignored the overall safeness of plane.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tInspired by the book, I, along with some classmates, conducted an experiment about conformity, people’s\ntendency to imitate group’s behaviors.

Most of the classes will be engineering related. Thus, there will be many opportunities for me to learn and develop an efficient workflow and problem-solving skill of game designing. I look forward to working on large projects to get inspiration from other talented students. It will be a great place to enhance my knowledge in both technology and art.

As the design manager, my job was to communicate with staffs and to match task with capable personnel.Between hundreds of photos and articles to work on, we decided to abandon the traditional method of working as a big group. Instead, we would work in pairs to maximize efficiency. I introduced a cloud sharing service that allowed several designers to discuss and work on projects at the same time. Then I collected our works and delivered the draft to other members to check errors. With this method, we finished designing a few days ahead of the deadline. I believe a leader should be innovative and allow each member to maximize his or her talent.However, not everything went smoothly. When we were designing the layout of the yearbook, there was a conflict between the designers and the editors. Our designers objected the original plan of including each club’s photos, because their low resolution would damage the visual quality of the yearbook. After I communicated with them, they agreed to compromise: we shrink the photos and put more introductions. Thus, we hid the flaw of the photos and included more information.While collaborating, we can accommodate members’ situation to form a customized and efficient work solution. Since we have different preference and capability, conflicts are inevitable. However, I appreciated the disagreement within a group because it helps us quickly identify an issue and improved our works once solved.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Engineering Online Destination\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOne of my favorite online destinations is a channel on YouTube called “Kurzgesagt – In A Nutshell.” It is a channel full of scientific- or educational-based animation that explains some common questions on our textbooks, such as the possibility of space elevator and the pros and cons of nuclear energy. I discovered the channel when I was preparing for my geography final exam and found some animated videos that introduced the structure of Earth on this channel. I still remembered the vividly animated graphs of the atmosphere of Earth that impressed me and helped me a lot for the exam. Since then, I became addictive watching these videos to better comprehend the knowledge I learnt from school because these animations are more effective than our textbooks.Not only do I feel satisfied by the depth of the knowledge, but the smooth animation and lively characters also intrigue me. As someone who enjoys coding and designing, I later taught myself simple animation making with these videos as my template. I would download them and observe the patterns frame by frame. Many details were missed when I watched it for the first time, such as twinkling stars in the background. But when I was making an animation, these elements make whole scene polished and balanced.This channel makes science look beautiful. It is a place where I solidify my knowledge and appreciate the animation. I embrace the method of using animations to explain abstract knowledge.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Explain your educational and career interests and why Annenberg is the best match for you.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a future communication major student, I will develop an expressive approach of communication at Annenberg.

All the courses help me produce a proper way of oral, written, and digital communication to diverse audiences or situation. Once I have a comprehensive understanding of communication knowledge, I would like to put it into use in mass media. Many classes are related to mass media, which is my ultimate pursuit of communication. I will learn to apply theoretical knowledge of communication to digital media in advertising.Annenberg will also prepare me for my future career.

    "CommonApp": "“Look at your sister!” This has been the tagline of my childhood. I grew up constantly looking at an improved reflection of myself. I’m a twin, an identical one at that. I grew up attending the same schools, activities, and groups as my sister; essentially, we shared the same life. And my parents were always in the background, constantly telling me to be more like my sister.This is not to say that being a twin didn’t have its advantages. I had a friend and confidant at all times. It meant that, in a country of only siblings, I was pretty unique, despite having a stunt double. It meant that, when we got in trouble in the classroom, confused teachers would simply threaten both of us. Yet, for each advantage, I encountered difficulties.Unlike my sister, I was born left-handed. It’s not like I chose to be this way; it just happened. But, to my parents, this was unacceptable. When they’d see me doing homework with the opposite hand, they’d grab my pen and give me the usual line: “Look at your sister!” So was I the strange one? I asked my parents why I couldn’t write with my preferred hand; I asked them why I couldn’t be different.“Of course you can be different. But, I mean, how different can you actually be?”I lost my courage to argue any more. I began to believe that as a twin, being identical to my sister was not an advantage, but an obligation. I no longer rejected when I was forced to use the wrong hand, even when the pen slipped out of my weak right fingers again and again. Having a twin was not only a problem at home. Of course, the struggle followed me to school, where my classmates enjoyed comparing the two of us. They compared our grades, sports and even our dances at the school performance. Over and over, it seemed like she came out on top.It might sound odd, but everything changed one day when I chose to wear a blue hairpin to school. I laughed happily at the mirror as I looked at myself next to my sister; she had on a pink hairpin. Of course, we were still together: going to school together, coming home together, doing homework together. But at least I had something to separate myself, some means to construct my own identity. And the blue hairpin was only the beginning. From that moment on, I sought to define myself as someone more than a twin.When we got to tenth grade, my sister and I were separated into different schools, and, in the next few years, I began to notice more qualities that separated the two of us. I realized that, while I loved reading and would lose myself in a novel, my sister couldn’t focus on a story for more than fifteen minutes. I’d look up from a book and find her staring at me wide-eyed: “You’ve been reading for three hours…” So? I thought to myself. Could this be jealousy? In the past, I would have traded my interest in literature for her skill in art; perhaps, my sister was thinking the exact opposite the whole time.Look at your sister. I used to think this phrase was always directed at me, an admonishment that suggested inferiority. Now I know this is not the case. While my sister has never mentioned it, I’m sure she’s felt the same resentment towards these comparisons. After all, we may look the same, but, underneath, we have radically different identities. I don’t need everyone else to see this; all that matter is I know it to be true.",

Of course, UND is a well-known religious community, and I look forward to meeting students who have radically different background, both cultural and religious. ;I’m also excited to be part of UND’s public service community. I understand that a vast majority of Notre Dame students perform social services as undergraduates and a large contingent go on to volunteer work after graduation. I believe this reveals not only the University’s focus on a moral education; it shows UND’s practicality. I think, for our society to endure through troubling times, it’s important that people entering the workforce bear a moral responsibility. After all, an education at Notre Dame would be wasted if graduates simply sought their own success after college, rather than the success of people around them. ;I believe that UND would be the perfect place for religious studies and the best school to pursue a life of service. I believe Notre Dame will help me fulfill these two immense goals.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Home is where your story begins.

I mean this in the most positive way.I used to believe in everything. Unfortunately, my parents liked to trick me. My father would give me cold medicine and say it was candy; my mother told me that if I didn’t eat mushroom, I would be turned into a witch.At first, I hated those lies. I was too young to realize they were benefiting me. Once I was old enough, I recognized that morality is nuanced. While many of us assume that any lie is reprehensible, it’s not that clear-cut. My judgments should not be simply led by my common perceptions toward phenomena. ;My experience with my parents led me to be a non-traditionalist and an enduring skeptic. I might criticize a popular film that everyone seems to love. I will push back on the common belief in China that all religion is dangerous. I will search for the truth behind each and every claim. ;My home inspired me to doubt, and to establish my own opinion."

    "CommonApp": "I’ve always felt that yoga was my past-life partner. At nine years old, as my classmates ran to ballet and its bright pink tutus, I strolled right to yoga classes and its free form garb. Three years ago everything changed when my teacher started doing handstands in class. I cannot do an inversion. It would seem that for each attempt, no matter how supplemented with support walls, instructional videos, and sheer force of will, there is always the falling action and the collapse back down to the mat. So why is it that I fail? Why can’t I get it right? The short answer is that I do not know or I could do it, on the other hand, in the spirit of personal exploration I shall present to you some hypothesizes for my failure. The first problem was always courage. I’d get up against the wall. Center my mind, fight against the strain in my arms and… I’d stay still. I didn’t want to fall. I couldn’t take the risk to push away and trust my body to hold me in the air.  The same thing happened to me last year. I went to a place where people went bungee jumping, and then to my complete dissatisfaction I watched my friend take a plunge into the abyss from the side—too scared to jump myself.  He was fine of course, better than fine, his beaming face and wind blown hair testament to the thrill of the plunge. So why can’t I push off the wall? Why didn’t I bungee jump? After this instance I made myself let go more, relishing the collapse to reality as part of the rise and fall of my own life. You can bet that if I get another chance to bungee jump I’m not going to stay pressed up the wall again. The second problem might not be of strength or courage but instead the tranquility and calm required for a handstand. Did you know I love coffee! My favorite word is tretar, a Swedish word that means the action of asking for a second cup of coffee. I tretar a lot. Maybe too much. I love how this bitter dark drink invigorates my mind and accompanies a long day in the library or a small café with a book or a project. I can see myself at university sitting with my friends and discussing work over coffee—teaching them the true meaning of tretar. And yet, perhaps tretar is one of the problems with my handstands. Energy is important, and its something I definitely don’t lack, however quiet and focused resolve is too. So maybe to rise into a perfect handstand I need both the braveness to push off but also the patience to reach for and develop superior balance. Finally, there exists the problem of persistence. I’ve been trying this for three years, but maybe in relative terms that’s not too long but too short? My father named me after his favorite Ming Dynasty emperor with the hope that like my namesake, I would have the air of effortless success. But, what if this name encourages me to merely imagine that I have the ability without putting the work in? The life of a normal person requires one to get messy and sweaty and to fail over and over before attaining success. Maybe I’ll succeed next year and then even this essay is part of the road to achieving my goal.So far, I’ve failed every time I’ve tried but I’m going to keep going. I learn from my failure and improve myself time after time. It is the hardest things that are worth achieving and I’m so excited to keep failing and learning in the pursuit of one day standing on my hands.",

However, it wasn’t until I saw ND’s award-winning “What Would You Fight For?” series that I realized ND is the one, the only one.In my childhood, I loved superman movies. I aspired to be a superman (superperson!), fighting for the human race and conquering evil. As I have grown older, the concern for those, left behind in my country’s rise to economic success, who are stuck in economic and environment poverty wring my heart. I hope to use my educational privilege and human power to create a better living environment for them. I have watched every video in the series. These two-minute segments demonstrate the deep and abiding benevolence in every member of the ND family. Equipped with knowledge and abilities learnt from school, they integrated their life with social concerns. I believe this is the essence of education, and only ND achieves that. I can’t imagine how lucky I would be to have the ND family stand at my side as we fight together for what really matters. ;"

    "CommonApp": "When I first arrived at Duke, the American life was the same as I had always imagined: people ate hamburgers, spent their free time playing sports and religiously used Instagram to capture and share every moment of their lives. While all these were familiar scenes to me, a fan of American movies and TV series, I still found myself out of place. I’m accustomed to drinking hot, boiled water, but my American counterparts relished in icy cold drinks. In back of my mind, I heard my mom quietly reminding me, \"When in America, do as Americans do!\" Since this was my first trip abroad alone, my mom was anxious about everything. I remember calming her down before taking my flight, reminding her that I had logged in more than 10,000 hours of watching American TV shows and that in Malcolm Gladwell's words, I'd be an expert of American culture! I immediately began to feel a growing tension between my deeply rooted and instinctive \"Chinese-ness\" and my conscious effort to be American.Trying my best to fit into American college life, I began to do what others sometimes accuse we Chinese people of doing quite well: copycatting. If a psychiatrist were to diagnose me and my actions, he or she would find the whole thing quite ironic; in order to adopt another cultural identity, I was invoking one of Chinese people's key traits: conformity. To help me fulfill my mission to become more American by the day, I decided to get help from few of my classmates who were Chinese Americans. They took me shopping at a nearby mall and helped me buy \"cool\" t-shirts with spunky and at times politically incorrect messages. During breakfast, they trained me how to cut, toast and spread cream cheese on this thing that looked much less exciting than a donut called a bagel.While I was obsessed with shedding my Chinese-ness, my Cultural Anthropology class was all about being cognizant of and respecting how different cultures develop over time and through unique circumstances that surround them. My professor, who was an African American lady, seemed inspiring as she exuded genuine enthusiasm and appreciation for her own culture despite the painful history and realities of racism and slavery. In direct contrast with my attitude, she never shied away from her own identity. Instead she proudly introduced different genres of rap music and African American communities' long and honorable march towards more civil rights and liberties. I even noticed that one pair of her earrings was a silhouette of Africa. Her confidence and love for her own culture made her look radiant.That night, lying on bed feeling restless, I asked myself, \"If one doesn't respect his or her own culture, why should others respect that person's culture?\" Abandoning my own culture automatically deprived others’ chances in knowing the real me. The goal of spending three weeks in America wasn't just a one way street of me absorbing all that is American, but a two way street where I also add to its famous melting-pot diversity and share with them what I love about my own culture.After the introspection, I began to dress-up in the traditional costumes that I had brought with me, curl up my hair with chopsticks and make dumplings for my classmates. I no longer avoided talking about China and felt awkward when my classmates asked politically incorrect things about my country. Instead, I mustered up the courage to use whatever English communication skills I had gathered over the years to calmly articulate my points and contribute to class discussions. For example, I felt elated when my professor became passionate explaining different dialects in America after I had introduced different dialects in China to the class.The rewarding experience taught me the importance of accepting my own culture in order to appreciate other cultures and allow others to appreciate my own.",

The current reality is evolving in a manner that Huxley had foreseen in 1931. Most of us believe that we are free from domination and oppression. But are we really free? Nowadays, we yield to the sweet pleasure and convenience brought by technology and no longer have the energy to think critically. Moreover, the rapidly emerging materialism which emphasizes quantifiable measurements of happiness and human worth may erode our humanistic values.To fight against Huxley’s world from becoming our own, we have to resist our instinct to categorize people and their worth especially based on traits we can't control. The underlying themes in the book have real significance and arouse my thinking. That’s why it’s my favorite book."

    "CommonApp": "I walked onto the stage.In front of me were over five hundred unfamiliar faces. I could hear my pulse pounding in my temples. I had been waiting for and dreading this moment for a while, and my brain was humming with tension and excitement. My right hand was firmly gripping the microphone like a pale starfish: “Hi everyone, my name is Lancer Li and I am an exchange student from China. I want to introduce to you a service program called Bilingual Reading Project…”I gave two speeches to the entire school during the third month of my exchange program. I was trembling the entire time. Being a newcomer is more intimidating than I thought–every day, not only did I try to hold onto the few friendships I had managed to establish, but I strived to appear at ease. I hated to be seen as different, as an outsider. But my label “exchange student” meant that I would leave soon, and the impact I could have on the school society would be far more limited than everyone else. So, what about going onto the school stage and promoting a program I started, managed and put tremendous effort into? What about leading a team of people I didn’t know at all? I wrestled with those ideas for weeks before I summoned my courage to walk into the principal’s office and give Dr. Moran my project proposal–thankfully, my preconceived fears didn’t stop me.Students and teachers started sending me emails and talking to me in the hallway, expressing their interests in participating in the program and helping blind children in China, or simply encouraging me to work harder and be a “man for others.” I was overwhelmed with love and joy, and more excitingly, I managed to put together a team of over thirty American students, who would record the English version of the bilingual literatures.Leading a team of many freshmen and seniors, however, can be quite challenging. Several freshmen happily signed up and never showed up again, while seniors, suffering from potent “senioritis” in the last months of high school, simply did not care much. I spent days discussing with teachers and trying to motivate my teammates. I published a story in the school newspaper, the Prep News. I also cooperated with Campus Ministry pastoral teams by telling them how much blind children in China loved reading and craved learning English, and what Bilingual Reading Project meant to both them and me.Nothing was more frustrating than receiving an email from a participant on a due date, saying that he needed another week for the recordings. However, nothing energized me more than completing the audio recordings of the stories of The Little Mermaid or Pride and Prejudice with my new American friends. The result of introducing Bilingual Reading Project to St. Louis University High School was more than delightful. I collected numerous valuable recordings for the program. I cherished my nerve-wracking public speaking experience and became much more confident in later student-led discussions. I joined the Prep News and the school pastoral team, where I met some of my best friends. I felt, for the first time, that I belonged to the school society.Looking back, my first decision to go on the stage generated so much momentum for me to overcome new challenges.As I was visiting Nanjing School for the Blind after going back to China, Yuxiao, the Director of Student Life, told me teachers and students truly appreciated the new series with the authentic American voices. Meanwhile, the number of Bilingual Reading’s online listeners skyrocketed–from four thousand to over fifteen thousand. I was able to help many more online English learners in mainland China.I was happy and grateful that I took the initiative, assumed my leadership role and persisted, and that I encountered so many loving souls who encouraged me to walk further with determination.",

I was the lab rat, the first Chinese international student. St. Louis became my home.Living on a different continent–8300 miles from parents–is hard. Thankfully, living and growing in St. Louis has been a true blessing. ;I stayed with a loving host family of African American and Native American heritages, a family that supported me spiritually, educated me on modern day racism and embedded in my heart the seeds of political activism. ;Learning from SLUH art teachers and visiting Sam Fox School studios at Washington University in St. Louis complemented my experience in Chinese art classrooms and offered me more flexible, open-ended perspectives in my artistic interpretations of the reality.Living far away from parents helped me reflect on my family relationship. Had I not chosen to live so far from my hometown, I would never have missed my grandmother’s fried dumplings so dearly or learned to appreciate every simple road trip with my father.These two years in St. Louis transformed me. I became more independent, reflective and grateful."

    "Supps": "题目：College of Arts and Sciences - What work of art, music, science, mathematics, or literature has surprised, unsettled, or challenged you, and in what way?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I remember putting down the book in tears, trembling to gather my thoughts.In The Secret Scripture, Sebastian Barry, in the most poetic language, fiercely snatched my heart to the most violent age of the Irish upheaval, to the remotest, bleakest corner of a unknown mount, where, Roseanne Clear, a beautiful Irish Protestant woman, endured for decades the hatred from a prejudiced society for her nonexistent marriage infidelity.Throughout the book, numerous people suffered from the alienation from the society, yet only one, Dr. Grene, spontaneously attached himself to the social margin for the salvation of Roseanne’s dignity.The memories of being bullied immediately flashed back to me, when for two years I was taunted for my girlish handwriting. When the boys called me sissy and elbowed me during distance running, I used to get mad; why wasn’t there a Dr. Grene standing behind me? ;But now I wonder, why not me? Why should I NOT suffer? A life free of alienation and wounds seems perfectly desirable, but meanwhile, this mentality occur to me as both unrealistic and arrogant; as millions, around the world, down the history, have lived or are living Roseanne’s tragedies, should I mourn over my temporary difficulties, or should I become a Dr. Grene, standing more a less privileged soul?Lives exist in parallels. We hurt and get hurt, but we would always expect a Dr. Grene in our dark times, justifying all our claims with the most soothing tone and the most careful reasonings. ;Roseanne’s tears was cold after ages of solitude. My tears were still burning hot in my cheeks.Suffering is inevitable and the desired miracle didn’t happen to me, or it just never would. ;But I can still look out for Roseannes.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：We are a community with quirks, both in language and in traditions.

I can draw on anything, scratch paper (obviously), napkins, free commercial handouts and even my own hands. However, the subject of drawing never changes: always simple portraits.I can trace this habit back to my third grade studio art practice, when my mentor taught me the drawing of human face with just a few lines. The simplicity of such tiny portraits fascinated me, who at the time was still struggling with simple geometric models. I immediately started experimenting with my own portraits, whenever I can, wherever I can.By the time I finished the pretzels, one side my napkin had already been decorated with quick portraits of a baby and an old man. ;I put down my pen and pressed the overhead button to summon the air attendant. ;“Hmmm, can I have some more napkins?”"

    "CommonApp": "A strange yet recurring feeling kept striking me, when I stopped the final gas chromatography analysis, when I finished calculating the conversion rate of the reactant, and when I typed in the last word of my research report. “Do not stop here, you’re doing the right thing”, and I followed it, spontaneously. Those moments gradually made me aware of the very thing I would take as a lifelong endeavor—chemistry and research. The summer of 2016 marked the beginning of my research career. Taking part in Dongrun-Yau Science Award (Chemistry) contest was a decision without hesitation, and such a rewarding experience brought me a summer brimmed with the pungency of chemicals and the sweetness of accomplishment. With two friends also dedicated to chemistry, I sought to bring a brand new and effective method of catalyst synthesis—atomic layer deposition—to an existing reaction—selective conversion of furfural to cyclopentanone. Various problems emerged the moment we set about conducting the experiment, namely lack of equipment, operation failures and coordination difficulties. I could still recall how afraid of being rejected I was when persuading a professor in Nanjing University into offering unfamiliar and inexperienced high school students the access to an autoclave, toxic nanoparticles, high pressure gas and a gas chromatograph in his laboratory. At first, contrary to what I had expected—simply adding the reactant and catalyst into an autoclave and pumping hydrogen, there were countless essential operation details I had neglected. It was then that I started perusing previous studies in search of those details and reaction conditions, by which I surprisingly gained a general sense of how to write academic papers. The next week was filled with preparation work, during which my partners even claimed to have seen my excitement through the sparkles in my eyes. Nevertheless, the pivotal part of the experiment was never smooth, either. Unsatisfactory results, ensuing quarrels, and a separation when we each went to summer schools all added to the difficulty. At Cornell University Summer College, checking their progress was my first task in the morning and I even hoped to set the apparatus through my phone screen or dig a hole on the ground to travel back and forth. Finally done with the experiments, I also struggled to finish our research report, trying to be precise with word selection, strict with the format of reference...Three months is way too short a period to figure out each reason behind the results, and plenty of questions were left for further study, for which I am really anxious. The sense of fulfillment after completing this project was unprecedented, but chemistry has permeated my life long before 9th grade, the first year of my chemistry curriculum. The first time I saw my father, a professor of environmental engineering, doing experiments on sewage purification, I was amazed at how things could undergo such intangible yet drastic changes. I followed his graduate students to study the remediation of nitrate pollution in groundwater using fuel cells in 7th grade, during which I got the first taste of ions, galvanic cells, redox reactions, etc. Watching others doing experiments tempted me to conduct simple experiments in person. With a general sense of Vitamin C as an antioxidant and potassium permanganate an oxidizing agent, I grouped four classmates to compare the Vitamin C content in various vegetables in 8th grade. A year later, I collected samples of calcium carbonate, including eggshell, pearl powder and fishbone, to study the temperature at which thermal decomposition occurs for each sample. In addition, I have been following online chemistry courses on Coursera and Khan Academy, exploring many aspects of chemistry, including but not limited to inorganic, organic and physical. With a strong aspiration for scientific research, I earnestly look forward to more theoretical backup, experiments, and industrial experience in college, to help me realize the goal of making a difference to pharmaceuticals, health and conservation.",

Why will Cornell's College of Arts and Sciences be the right environment in which to pursue your interests?

Enchanted by the spellbinding changes in color and light, I started hands-on experiments in middle school. Unlike my peers, who started chemistry by memorizing chemical equations, I started with a comprehensive knowledge of basic principles, e.g., atomic structure, states of matter, and thermodynamics by watching videos on Khan Academy. I have always been proud of such overall understanding that helped me sail through chemistry problems in the following years. I love doing research, verifying my own hypotheses by self-designed experiments, and I am always excited about studying new theories. As my oldest friend, chemistry has offered me a feast for the eyes, the joy of success, the sweetness of overcoming setbacks, and the gratification of curiosity. ;Just as I am amazed by the light and heat emitted in chemical reactions, I marvel at how single notes make up pieces with great momentum. Just as I love stirring solutions with glass rods, I enjoy roaming around the keys. The piano led my way to the realm of classical music. I could recall how ecstatic I was when I was able to proceed to pieces of Chopin, Liszt and Debussy, knowing that all the pain of practising The Virtuoso Pianist in 60 Exercises and the Czerny etudes has paid off. I started to find the patterns of contemporary works, forming a general idea of style and genre through The Introduction to Classical Music on Coursera. Beginning with Ravel's La Valse, I started to enjoy works of Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff and Ravel not only for pleasure, but also for the harmony and orchestration. Instead of simply listening, I long for a professional perspective to better appreciate the techniques musicians used to impress me. ;However, I encountered difficulties when learning atomic structure. Without the knowledge of quantum physics and calculus, I could hardly understand orbitals and wave functions. I realized that the blurring boundaries among science disciplines make it difficult to achieve expertise in one field without knowledge in others. Besides, only universities specializing in music provide great courses in music in China. Therefore, I started looking for a US liberal arts education, seeking math and physics backup before specialization in chemistry, and a systematic education in music. ;My college research began with browsing the graduation requirements. Attracted by the rigor and flexibility of the chemistry major, the freedom to choose minors, and the distribution, breadth, writing and foreign language skills the courses provide, I applied for Cornell University Summer College to take a closer look at the College of Arts and Sciences and Cornell. While eating in RPCC, taking TCAT buses, studying in Olin Library till eight and walking back to Mary Donlon left an indelible impression on me, I was more fascinated by the music performance given by Wayne Lee and Mike Cheng-Yu Lee, and the rigorous course work. Unfamiliar with medical terminology, I had a hard time with my veterinary medicine course, but I received help from my lecturers, TA, and RCA, helping me bring my potential into full play—I was quite satisfied with my quizzes and final grades! The three-week miniature of college life and an Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Admissions Information Session in Klarman Hall prompted me to apply to Cornell. ;In College of Arts and Sciences, I hope to make full use of math and physics courses to prepare myself for advanced chemistry courses and honors based on independent research, and I wish to indulge myself in Lincoln Hall, to find the right people to talk about classical music. With an international background and eager to promote living conditions globally, I never regard the distribution, foreign language, writing and breadth requirements as a burden, but my once in a lifetime opportunities to gain a knowledge of the social and cultural background in certain areas to make contributions to conservation and health there."

He was still sitting in the darkness of the ramshackle attic, staring at the direction his mother left, his gray eyes emotionless.\" I finished typing the last word, mumbling to myself, \"Such a sorrowful theme! Next time, I should try something more optimistic.\"Historical Wuxia (Martial arts hero) novels enthralled me six years ago. While reading works by Jin Yong, a famous Chinese writer, I was awed by his intricately constructed plots that subtly hid a subtext insinuating criticism of the Chinese society. Since then, I have started reading diverse genres of novels, including historical accounts, science fiction, and Chinese Kung-Fu series. It is my entertainment and a way to break from the reality. More importantly, it opens a portal to a society beyond my student’s world.My first attempt at writing Wuxia novel was nothing more than a personal anecdote. When I shared my work, everybody seemed to dislike the idea of me writing novels. Unlike classical novels, Wuxia novels are generally viewed as distractions by the Chinese educational elites. One day, my teacher asked me for a private meeting to say:\"Why do you waste your time on novels? Read something more appropriate like dramas and poems.\"\"But just like plays or poems, novels can portray different emotions, thoughts, and values!\"Both my teacher and I were stunned by how loud and fast I responded to his question. As a result, I had to stand in his office for an entire morning.However, despite all these, my passion for writing novels did not diminish. I continued to write novels, as short as 30 words or as long as 120,000 words, whenever I felt an impulsive need to depict stories bubbling in my mind. Gradually, I engaged myself in the writing techniques, plot devices and the malleability of the Chinese language anchored in the pictographic script, which I could not have experienced in a classroom. Writing has built for me a mental palace where I felt the complete freedom to architect every single detail and set my imagination free to roam. In this little world of authorship, everything came alive to my beckoning.I feel strongly that although I had only one identity in the real world, I could experience different lives through my pen. From the insidious thoughts of criminals to the inner struggles of tragic heroes, I laughed and cried together with these characters. In the process, my emotions were further developed from the exploration of the variety of characters to the much-needed observations of daily life. I indeed use novels as the portal that connects me with the much more diverse thoughts and experience. As a young boy, I was fairly introverted, but my passion for writing has engaged me with the surrounding world. Now I have come to realize that my written works should be dedicated to the readers instead of being an egocentric endeavor--- it is not a selfish art. Last week, my secondary school teacher asked me for the latest chapter of my novel. Just as proudly, he told me that his favorite pastime now is reading novels by his former student.",

This was totally unbelievable to me, who have lived only with Chinese for the past 14 years of my life.Indeed, my days in Singapore were filled with Indian Prata, Singapore’s eclectic Laksa, and the curious Japanese pastries, to name a few. I celebrated Christmas, Vesak Day, Eid and Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival. In evenings, I spent hours telling stories about the Ming Dynasty and the origin of the Great Wall to my Singaporean friends and learned from them the meaning of the slang \"Kiasu\". I did not feel foreign in Singapore but instead felt genuinely welcomed by this diverse mix of nationalities, gender identities and backgrounds. From my experience in China where we are often placed in schools with similar ‘types’ of students, I realized how diversity encourages even more dialogue and exploration.As much as most people treat this as the new ‘norm’, I continue to be amazed with a kind of childish wonder with this world I am discovering. Maybe it is because of the city I grew up in, but I intend to make the most of all this amazing diversity I encounter, be part of it and also promote it, no matter where I go. I truly appreciate this is how the life should be celebrated, in all its many colors, types, interests, background and loves."

    "CommonApp": "I wanted my PowerPoint presentation for children at Dyslexic Association Singapore to be a blockbuster.Selecting a beautiful typeface was critical. Helvetica or Time New Roman? Too banal. Probably, the loops and squiggles of Snell Roundhand would impress the dyslexic children. 10 years ago I made a similar choice when start writing Chinese calligraphy. I fell for the cursive strokes of the running script. I know writing the beautiful running script would allow me to stand out from most beginners who practiced the regular script, which I thought was too commonplace. Nevertheless, standing beside my PPT slides, I experienced freezing coldness despite the glazing sun shining into the classroom through the windowpane. I instructed the students on basic addition, but when I asked if anyone could answer the sample question with word description, deafening silence enveloped me. Some stared at me with bewilderment, some were dozing. They had dyslexia. They often saw the mirror images of letters. They needed time. I kept reminding myself not to lose my temper. I raised my voice to explain every step slowly for a second time, and a third time until my voice became hoarse.Still no response. My hope died off in the scorching heat and stuffy humidity in the air, like an orchid wilting at the window.I proposed a break to pause the embarrassment, squatted at the corner and buried my face in the arms. Suddenly, I sensed a gentle poke on my arm. A little boy stood beside me. I recognised him as the boy in the front row who kept turning around.\"Could you understand what I taught?\" I looked for an answer.He nodded his head, blinking with his big innocent eyes.\"Could you do the sample question?\" I asked, patting his head gently.I caught his hesitance. His head  lowered down slightly, but turned left and right thereafter to indicate a \"no\" answer.\"The words on the slides were not clear…\"How to make the words clearer? I shuddered. I did not want to believe it, but it might be the problem of Snell Roundhand. I retrieved my laptop and tried a few other typefaces: the cool SansBlack, the nifty Chalkboard and the formal Georgia, but his eyes moved up and down. However, when it came to Helvetica, his eyes brightened.I was surprised at his choice, but thinking about it for a second time, I realized my design concept was entirely wrong. The decorative and ornate strokes of Roundhand looked beautiful to me, but only confused them. Lacking the capability to read easily, the dyslexic children needed the typeface to be clear and simple, like Helvetica.One is like one's typeface. I assumed Snell Roundhand and running script in calligraphy to be appealing, but they were in fact flamboyant acts of an attention seeker. I forgot that the foremost function of typeface in a design was to effectively convey the messages to the target audience.On the other hand, Helvetica exists to deliver ideas without dominating over the content, directing the passengers in the subway station, or displaying information on various digital device. Its omnipresence often makes us forget its presence, but it elegantly allows the readers to focus on the content. A few weeks later, when I was drafting a design of notebook covers for the Big Bridge Academy Bookstore, the image of dyslexic children appeared in mind, and my attention naturally fell on Helvetica. I started to embrace it. It symbolizes getting rid of anything superfluous and reminds me to stay focused on the most central issue. No longer am I obsessed with pursuing specialness for the sake of it, and Helvetica's minimalism is a way of being special. I want to live and do things as simple and clear as Helvetica.",

Developing a model for satellite distribution around Earth during Singapore International Mathematical Challenge, I saw the indispensability of programming in math modelling; Intrigued by shapes of protein molecules, like alpha helix or beta pleated sheet, I started to learn about computational chemistry, which requires an in-depth understanding of computer sciences and quantum physics. Thus, acquiring knowledge in different sciences from Mudd's Core, especially through courses like the Core Lab, can best satiate my intellectual thirst.Moreover, training in HSA allows me to be a critical thinker understanding the impact of sciences on the society. In Knowledge&Inquiry, I read about Milgram's controversial psychological experiment, and started pondering questions like \"Do we have free will or are we controlled by the authority?\" and \"What is the moral boundary of scientific experiments?\" Learning various schools of thoughts in morality, from the virtue theory to deontology to utilitarianism,  ;I realize that no single theory is perfect, but we should debater over such problems rather than remain silent. Hence, I look forward to investigate the interrelation between sciences and human actions through  ;courses like PHIL179B and STS010.Mudd also turns theoretical training into practical use with its very special clinical program. Math Department's past program with Walt Disney Animation Studio to extract information from the tools' data excites me. The mere mention of the Disney attracts a girl obsessed with cartoons since childhood, not to say working for it. I also remember during Project Work, my team made use of data collected from participants to analyze the impact cellphone use on human interaction. In the process of applying statical skills, we learnt of knowledge not covered in textbooks like the chi-squared test. Hence, the clinical program equips me with skills to transform the matrices and numbers into lenses to view real-life problems, and practice further enhances learning.Apart from the academics, the people in Mudd would also make my college life meaningful. Professor Arthur Benjamin's commitment in spreading the beauty of mathematics to wider audience tells me that teachers here really aspire to be impactful. My years in Math Appreciation Club were dedicated to similar efforts. Using mathematics to fix Rubik's cubes or drawing comics to teach math theories happened constantly to engage the student population. The relationship between us and our audience was reciprocal: as we searched for the best communicate strategy, we improved our own understanding. Thus, Professor Benjamin is my role model, inspiring me to continue reaching out to others my drawing of math comics, and helping with Homework Hotline.Therefore, I look forward to being a Mudder, who can not only reason and research, but also critique and communicate."

    "CommonApp": "I shuffled toward the dock and stood still at the edge, clenching my fists and reassuring myself it was just a jump. The Brave Dive, YMCA's tradition that requires campers to plunge into the cold sea to greet the new day, had come to my turn. I looked back but only saw the challengers who jumped ahead of me dripping wet and shivering in the wind. Their faces went pale; lips became blue; teeth chattered with coldness. Looking at the rippleless muddy water again, I deemed it as a howling abyss which kept terrifying me not to venture a step further or it would devour me. I hesitated and then flinched, standing there like a coward penguin.Vivid memories of how I cowered likewise when being told my plan of making a pollutant-testing machine was merely a fantasy flooded me. \"I'm gonna make a portable machine that can test pollutant components in the sewage.\" Claimed I excitedly, \"Then the Treatment Plant can make targeted solutions and dispose the sewage more efficiently while cost less.\" Nevertheless, the crowd kept convincing me of being humble instead of supporting me, \"Don't be silly. You barely know the operating principle of a pollutant tester. Let alone to make one.\" Their harsh words punched me heavily and did make me hesitate. Was I going beyond my depth in inventing that machine? I preconceived the potential challenges—no funding; no technical assistance; no working time—on my mind over and over again, beginning to mistrust and fear for my ambition. What if I still fail after sparing every effort?I vacillated, as I am now doing at this edge, balking and dreading to step further. \"Jimmy, now!\" My counselor shouted and dragged me out of my memory. At the moment of mind blanking, I jumped into the sea. The frigid water surrounded me immediately; however, I wasn't paralyzed by the coldness as I thought. Instead, my muscles adapted to the temperature quickly and I was able to come up for air.The feeling of resurrection fulfilled my heart. The joy enabled me to recall the struggling experience. When lingering around the line between giving up and putting up, I read Roosevelt's speech and was impressed by “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\". I was haunted by the fear of failure all the time before starting my Pollutant tester project; like on the dock I kept telling myself not to jump because I might not finish the dive perfectly as those boys. Whereas, it wasn't only good outcomes or honors meant; it was also how we strived and dared to conquer the challenges.Outcomes satisfy others; processes enriched doers themselves. Figuring these out, I started my project along with other three friends two years ago, blanking my mind as I dive into the ocean at this moment. Being challenged all the time but never compromised, we fought persistently against the setbacks inside and outside. In the countless revisions for design drawings and exhausting experiments for tester systems, I was rewarded with more professional academic knowledge and solider friendships. Upon completion of the project, I harvested more than a machine, but also courage and confidence.When climbing onto the dock and yelling to the sky, I felt the same satisfaction I had at the moment when I successfully ran our Spectrophotometry Pollutant Tester. I strode to my buddies, with a new sense of pride, a new sense of confidence, and a new sense of courage, for I didn't fail myself nor my dear friends. Looking back, I saw clearly that magnifying fears of the unknown brought nothing but indecisiveness. Instead, taking bold steps to fight enabled me to explore further.

I hope I can make even a subtle difference to the world. NYU tells me I can do more. ;“Challenging with unconventional wisdom in and of the city, and drawing inspiration from its vitality.” NYU fosters continual innovation in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship through a wide variety of offerings both inside and outside the classroom. Distinctive and top-quality education and various research projects in NYU not only enhance students’ knowledge and practical skills, but also broaden students’ scopes and visions. I long to dig up all my potential while rigorously cultivated in NYU. I can learn not only facts but also how to learn and how to think. NYU enables me to improve my project on pollutants, helping me to better treat pollutions and analyze the environment by using advanced mathematics skills.I am keen on Mathematics since I was a little child. All Geometry puzzles in high school textbooks can be settled by five basic Euclidean geometry axioms; complicated results are predicted by analyzing a set of simple data. To a children like me, Mathematics is so amazing. In my view, it broadens man’s vision and enables us to get rid of logical confusions; correlations between various factors can be unified and then updated by Mathematics. Locating in the biggest international financial center, NYU has one of the strongest education quality on mathematics. Numerous elites working in Wall Street indicate the power of math modelling – how it help people analyze and predict. I long to learn math in such great college to serve my community. ;“Ideas are free to exchange; research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish.” NYU tutors, “ Then you can contribute to the betterment of our world.” Diverse and inclusive community carrying on regional, national, and global commitments, NYU ardently pursues his goal of making scholars who are strong, bright, useful, and true. There are packs possessing wisdom, responsibility and excellence here, whose boundless allegiance to its community."

    "CommonApp": "“Why leave me alone in Shanghai?”I always asked my parents on the phone. “You are too young to understand now, but I promise to let you when you are older.”When I was 5, my parents left me to my grandparents and went to work in Beijing. Although we talked over the phone every week and met once in a few months, I had never heard from them the answer I want. “Am I a trouble for my parents?” I sometimes questioned myself. However, when I turned 9, my parents finally brought me to Beijing to live with them. My dream came true. “Milk or soy milk?” My mom would ask me every morning at breakfast. A simple question like this was enough to make me feel happy. But this feeling of happiness deterred me from raising my long-hidden question again as I feared hearing something that might throw me back into the dark old days. In a summer day when I was 12,my parents were out. I started doing chore as usual. As I was organizing the cabinet, I found a letter. Who writes letters in these days? Driven by curiosity, I opened the envelope. A word that was strikingly similar immediately caught my eyes. My name. This letter was supposed to be delivered to me although I had never received it. I read on. Then, I could not move my eyes away from it. It told a sad story. Three months before my parents left for Beijing, they had a road trip to Inner Mongolia with their friends. A bad car crash took place due to an unexpected snowstorm. My father’s best friend was seriously injured. He was disabled for life. My father owed his friend a lot of help during the college years, so he decided to move to Beijing, where his friend lived, to look after him and his aging parents.At night, I told my parents about the letter. After moments of silence and consideration,they decided to be completely honest with me.I found out that they did not send out that letter because they could not decide whether it was in my best interest. They worried that the “truth” would only convince me that they chose their friend over me and thus hurt me more. On the other hand, they were reluctant to lie to me as they thought that the discovery of their lie would eventually cost my trust towards them. It was indeed a dilemma that I was too young to understand when I was only 5. At that time, there was no better alternative for them – it was impossible to take care of their disabled friend and me at the same time. Although their explanation did not eliminate my child shadow overnight, I got to know my parents better - they were actually more responsible and braver than I had thought. I was drawn closer to them because of this realization. In the years that followed, I grew up, gradually stepping out of my parents’ s protection and into the real world. The older I became, the harder for me to say an answer or a decision is right or wrong. When all the possible choices are imperfect, what we decide to do determines what kind of person we are. In a family, a brave and responsible man will try his best to protect his parents and children even if the decision may cost some of the happiness the family members currently possess, while in a society, he will be able to sacrifice the interests of the minority for those of the majority. As the class representative, in order to help the students who cannot keep up with the study, I will not hesitate to ask my teacher to slow down and explain each problem more meticulously. This will certainly affect the efficiency of the top students, but it benefits the others who are more in need of help. The fact that choosing from imperfections is difficult does not mean we should refrain from making decisions. Instead, it is exactly when we should become truly considerate and responsible people.",

I was born on a bright sunny afternoon in 1998. That’s why the character of “sun” is in my name. However, I enjoy reading Vachel Lindsay amid rainstorm: ;Look you, I’ll go pray - ;“Sweet Mary, make me cleanThou rainstorm of the soul,Thou wine from worlds unseen.”Whenever I feel fatigued, the cold rain washes the dust off my soul. ;After the rain comes the sun. In broad daylight, I morph into one of Tagore’s Stray Birds, travelling through the beautiful landscapes inside the “paintings in words”. Poems are my tinted-glasses, through which I observe the phenomenal world of Immanuel Kant, colorful and emotional. When I am angry or sad, poets whisper in my ears, helping me unclench my fists and give me the wings of letting go to explore the vast blue sky. ;I also read poems to sense the experience that I cannot live through. I like Xu Zhimo, a Chinese poet who died in the 1930s, and I read him in Longtang, or neighborhoods circumscribed by alleys, narrow, winding and distinct to Shanghai. In April, raindrops wash the white walls, and melancholy permeates the moist air around me. It is where history and present meet. It is where the poet lived, loved and died. ;But today will unavoidably become yesterday. The maze of longtang will someday be shadowed and replaced by shopping malls and high rises. I read poems to catch the vanishing voice of yesterday, to explore the place I grow up and belong to and to discover my cultural identity. ;Let poem be the unique voice of life. Let me be a good listener, next to Willy’s Statue, under the shade of the luxuriant oaks. I would like to share with other Rice students my imaginations, sentiments and cultural background through poems in occasions like Poetry Slam Night. The Rice residential college, a close-knit community, shall be a place to read poems, which I see as a good way to get to know people and their stories. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Please briefly elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities or work experiences.

To me, the human world can be as amazing as the music world. ;The store’s boss is a kind person who allows me to stay after work and listen to music alone. Schubert’s Piano Sonata No. 17 in D major, D850 is always my favorite. In music, I enjoy the companion of my solitude.

As a person who tend to learn better by applying knowledge to the real-world contexts, I am particularly interested in the Social Sciences Applied Innovation Lab under the Gateway program, in which I can carry on my passion of researching socioeconomic inequality issues through collaborating with non-profit organizations.

Speaking from my experiences, I interpret it as challenging the status quo in creative ways to benefit one’s community and the society. ;I have been experimenting with unconventional ways to address social issues. Last year, I founded a social service program, the first one of its nature in Shanghai, to bring together volunteers, young kids and the elderly in attempt to solve the seniors’ solitude problem and strengthen the young kids’ social skills. I read on RSVP’s page that Rice students do volunteer work in unconventional ways too, for example, the cooking-for-the-homeless competition. This approach appeals to me because it challenges people’s general perception that volunteering usually means more hard and tedious work than fun. I thus look forward to participating and learning from programs like RSVP.Rice students are more than unconventional; they are happy. In my opinion, their high level of life satisfaction owes a lot to the distinctive residential college system that effectively promotes race/class interaction. Moreover, in such a close-knit community, students from different backgrounds are able to exchange ideas and spark creativity. As an intended Economics major, I would love to imagine I live in a dorm filled with mathematicians, philosopher, artists and sociologist. This novel combination will help me analyze social problems from different angles and a holistic perspective. This is how “unconventional wisdom” is generated.At Rice, I believe, I can receive the education to achieve my personal ambitions and change the society for better. ;"

    "CommonApp": "Superhero fatigue had obviously got the most of the class. Having been bombarded with a dozen gorgeous-looking heroes with shiny hair, bright teeth and great muscles, many of the students started to yawn and look away from the screen. Until the unique superheroes of my creation showed up. Their ugly, twisted but amusing looks soon gathered a roomful of attention, and brought a loud laughter. “You two did a great job!” Someone came to us and said. “Bazinga!” I smiled to my partner.From the minute when we learnt about this psychological project, where we were asked to design three independent superheroes and make a video of them saving the world, we had been going over numerous past images of superheroes in the history. Bored with their highly homogeneous look: charming, neat and muscular, I came up with a bold idea: Why superheroes have to be gorgeous? Ours should be something different, I suggested to my partner, and that led us to make them ugly in a funny way. Then came the story plot part. Having watched a lot of detective movies, I decided to have the superheroes solve a murder. While recalling what I had watched, I easily thought of a number of superpowers it might take to solve a crime. Among all my partner and I finally settled for sharp eyes, sensitive nose and physical fitness. Following the plan, we decided to knead our superheroes out of plasticine. It would be very easy to make, and more importantly, it would make our project an enjoyable one.I began my “improvisation” following whatever popped up in my mind, regardless how ridiculous or inappropriate it may sound. Excited, I put my hands on the plasticine whilst doing impromptu image designs. I first endowed our “sensitive nose” with a specific power to control breaths, with which it was able to blow the murderer to the prison as long as it had its eyes on the criminal; and then I made a small red fan, wrapped it with green plasticine as its headgear, and made the nose three times of the ordinary to exaggeratedly emphasize its power; meanwhile, I twisted the sizes of its eyes and mouth giving our superheroes a distorted sense of charm, which comes from our “weird” design that did not seem to make any sense. In the end, my partner and I agreed to make it more of a character in Sponge Bob. We giggled our way through the making of the “nonsense”, which soon escalated into a sense of great joy and encompassed everyone in the classroom. Together, we made the three amusingly twisted superheroes finally “get into the act”. The enjoyment I had in creating these funny figures knew no bounds. This psychological project turned out to be a success and won us applauds and thumbs-ups. For me, the art of doing things well lies in making things fun. My motivation stems purely from “having fun”, which enables me to fully immerse myself in the process and taste the very enjoyment along the way. Making things fun also allows me to get rid of those “supposed to be” and frees me from “being reasonable”. Built upon the motto of “making things fun”, a superhero is not supposed to be a giant figure in order to “make sense”. Instead, I follow my true feelings towards what I see, hear and perceive and interpret them spontaneously. My genuine sense connects myself with the outer world, serving as the cradle where my instinct rests upon. Why so serious? Why everything has to make sense? Why not have some fun? This is what makes our sense towards our life vivid and count.",

Having actively interacted with people from various backgrounds in Guangzhou, one of the biggest trade centers in China, I learnt to embrace different opinions, and to discover new ways to solve problems. A school of diverse cultures, NYU appeals to me for its inclusive and tolerant environment, where numerous innovative and sparkling ideas have been bred every year. I believe I will significantly benefit from these inspiring thoughts and urther my current psychological research.The great desire to explore my grandmother’s depression also urged me to pursue psychology among the abundant opportunities offered by NYU. Desperate to turn my desire into action, I conducted a research about public attitudes toward depression and its prevention under the guidance of a PhD student. After days of interviews with participants and distribution of questionnaires, I did not only obtain more knowledge about depression, but also familiarized myself with the process and methodology in academic research. Fascinated by the whole scientifically exquisite process, I am greatly attracted to NYU’s wide range of research opportunities, such as laboratory courses including Lab in Psychopathology and Laboratory in Clinical Research, which could equip me with a systematic knowledge in data analysis and experimental design, so that I can further my current independent research.The education of NYU does not just end in the classroom setting. It provides its students with practical opportunities, such as internships and field work, which could significantly improve my ability of practical applications. I am excited to learn about applied psychology offered in NYU Steinhardt, which offers both field work in applied psychology, and internships in Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness, and these invaluable opportunities will help me better apply what I have learnt in a laboratory setting to meet practical needs. Hoping to focus on clinical psychology in the future, I want to develop an innovative and effective way to cure mood disorder, given the lack of systematic organization in the current treatment system for mental illness, especially the one for teenagers. Dedicated to “inventing new ways” to solve problems, NYU could provide me with various kinds of job opportunities through the NYU CareerNet and the Wasserman Center, and the chances to meet talented psychologists can help me to become creative in solving mental health problems and lay a foundation to my future career success."

    "CommonApp": "Last summer while volunteering at a public library, I was surprised to encounter numerous homeless people reading there. Even with no job or home, they still chose to spend their day bettering themselves, reading classic novels, short stories and even literary critique magazines. I used to think homeless people just walked around town all day in rags looking for food, sometimes even resorting to theft. That day, I saw first-hand that many of them were just like us, striving hard for a better life.As I left the library, I felt ashamed. I had always considered myself an open-minded person, but before that day, I’d never even really thought about homeless people. The surprise I felt made me realize how disconnected my understanding was compared with reality, and it really bothered me.The experience was a large reason why I decided to conduct an independent research project on rural healthcare problems in China. Healthcare and homelessness may seem unrelated, but they are in fact closely linked in Chinese society. Both rural residents and homeless people are marginalized populations, socially distant from urban residents. Thus, I wanted to better understand their realities, just as I’d learned about the homeless.While conducting my fieldwork in my parents’ home village, I quickly learned that rural medical services in China are terrible. Villages lack basic medical resources, with many clinics containing a few pieces of poor equipment and a couple of old, barefoot doctors. Accessibility is so bad that some villagers walk 2-hours to a clinic. I sat stunned listening to one old lady tell me that she received only 200RMB medical pension a month. She looked very fragile, with humped back and shaky legs; continuing to work in the fields would surely kill her. I thought of my parents, who live in an urban area. They received far more pension than her, and didn’t have to work into their graves.Many people I encountered were disgruntled and wanted better conditions. Yet, they had no way to change their situation. Most of them knew little about the Internet, politics, or even basic laws. As someone lucky to be born into privilege and resources, I wanted to help provide them a voice, to show them there are city people who care. Thus, following my fieldwork, I returned to my city and wrote a publication on the topic. I then began to give presentations on my work to raise awareness.In my first presentation, I remember many surprised faces amongst the audience. They had never known the challenges farmers faced and were moved by their struggle. This is exactly the knowledge gap – between privilege and non-privileged - that I wanted to fill. My investigation helped them realise what it is like to live in the countryside, to be disconnected and without options. As they left, they walked away with the same sense of responsibility and urgency I had, discussing the content of my presentation with one another passionately. I felt I had achieved something. In fact, after hearing of my research, some classmates followed suit, investigating similar issues. The reception, however, wasn’t all positive. People have told me that such a huge problem is too difficult even for the president, let alone a high school student. Many friends have said I am over-idealistic, and maybe I am. I realize now, though, that I grew up in a bubble, surrounded by many people who simply choose to accept that there is nothing we can do to help. They choose to turn away from problems that don’t directly affect them. I cannot do that anymore. Remembering the struggling old lady and the homeless in pursuit of better, I can no longer remain indifferent. I have to take steps, no matter how small, to fix things that are broken. I have to tell their truths, and use my privilege and resources to conquer ignorance and help those in need.",
    "Supps": "题目：Many human beings throughout history have found inspiration and joy in literature and works of art. Is there a book, play, poem, movie, painting, music selection, or photograph that has been especially meaningful to you?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          In The Castle by Franz Kafka, the main character, K, is requested by a castle to work there as a geographical surveyor. When he arrives, however, the castle refuses to admit him, even though it was the castle that requested K there in the first place; additionally by castle rules, he also cannot return to his previous home. Thus, throughout the book, K is stuck, continuously trying to be admitted to the castle, but constantly failing due to bureaucracy, betrayal, and inhumane treatment by the people of the castle. ;I believe that in this book Kafka’s goal is to depict a postmodern dystopian world where society is ruled by a mindless bureaucratic monster, represented by the castle. The book was unsettling to me because, in many ways, our society treats many individuals in much the same way as the castle treated K. Society can sometimes be cruel, and where there once were ethics and communal bonds, there is now only betrayals and indifference. K thus represents all those who fall outside of the mainstream, making futile efforts to beat alienation from the outside.Probably the most unsettling part of this book was that no one ever helped K. When faced with K’s suffering, most people ignore it, sticking simply to their own bureaucratic processes. They didn’t deliberately try to hurt K, but still acted as “silent accomplices.” As our society becomes more individualistic and materialistic, I see many people following a similar path as the people of the castle, and this path is very dangerous. As is displayed in The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,“First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Socialist. Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Trade Unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.” ;Throughout high school, I’ve participate in many activities aimed at helping those “on the outside”, from working with LGBT groups to raising awareness in healthcare inequality. I do this because I don’t want to be like the people in the castle. I want to always be someone who reaches out to help break the cycle of alienation and prevent anymore K’s in our society."

    "CommonApp": "Last summer while volunteering at a public library, I was surprised to encounter numerous homeless people reading there. Even with no job or home, they still chose to spend their day bettering themselves, reading classic novels, short stories and even literary critique magazines. I used to think homeless people just walked around town all day in rags looking for food, sometimes even resorting to theft. That day, I saw first-hand that many of them were just like us, striving hard for a better life.As I left the library, I felt ashamed. I had always considered myself an open-minded person, but before that day, I’d never even really thought about homeless people. The surprise I felt made me realize how disconnected my understanding was compared with reality, and it really bothered me.The experience was a large reason why I decided to conduct an independent research project on rural healthcare problems in China. Healthcare and homelessness may seem unrelated, but they are in fact closely linked in Chinese society. Both rural residents and homeless people are marginalized populations, socially distant from urban residents.

They are small, sneaky, and always scare people at the most unexpected moment. This seems to match the definition of insects, but of course, as scientists tell us, spiders are not insects. They have eight legs and insects only have six. And most people know this. However, most of us still treat spiders like insects. This shows that to some extent, we perceive the world regardless of objective knowledge. Instead, we prefer to look at things according to our practical experiences, experiences “on the field”.Even when scientists tell us that spiders are very good at capturing mosquitoes with their webs, and seldom harm people, we are still scared half dead when seeing spiders, because we see their creepy, silent movement, but don’t tend to see them eating pest. As a result, our primary experiences with spiders are summed up with “fright, hair standing on ends, and removing spiders as soon as possible” instead of “gratitude, pat them on their backs and a thank you note”.Well actually, we do literally pat them on their backs sometimes, leading to their death.It sounds unfair for spiders, one of the most efficient pest-killer species. We can blame information failure for this. Had all spiders counted the number of mosquitoes they killed and reported back to us humans, we would probably start petting spiders for the same reason farmer’s pet cats. But this is impossible because we cannot communicate with spiders.Spiders are not alone. There are so many similar cases in our society where certain social groups are treated like spiders. They do dirty jobs that seem insignificant. Coincidentally, these people are usually also the ones with the smallest volume—they can’t speak up. Because I grew up in a huge developing country, I have encountered numerous examples. When we think about it, street cleaners are very important to maintain a clean city. Yet in China, the stereotype is “dirty street cleaners with weird accents.” They are invisible to everyone unless they get too close to a passerby at a bus station, and the passerby will notice the cleaner dramatically and move away from her/him. I was not much different from the common passersby before I saw a cleaner near our school asking our English teacher questions about grammar in broken English. His studiousness and industriousness can put many to shame.It is understandable that most of us don’t realize the roles of some social groups in our society, because we are all very busy with our lives and have little time to take notice of this. We can’t blame them. However, I believe there should be advocates for these disadvantaged people, and I am very willing to do just that. There are more and more people realizing the value of spiders, and in China more people are expressing gratitude to street cleaners. Yet this is not enough. There are so many spiders still being neglected; just thinking about it saddens and scares me. ;As such, my goal is to one-day become a human-rights lawyer, who can gives voices to the voiceless. The University of Richmond’s mission statement states the a Richmond education should “prepares students to live lives of purpose, thoughtful inquiry, and responsible leadership in a global and pluralistic society. This statement resonates with me, and as a pre-law Spider, I believe I will be one step closer to helping the spiders of our society. ;"

    "CommonApp": "Since 10th grade, I have spent my weekends transplanting seedlings, planting, watering, and removing non-native weeds at Golden Gate National Park and East Bay Regional Park. The drought has deeply harmed the environment. In summer, weeds crawl on the arid ground like torn spider webs.  Sandy dunes and cracked earth extend miles into the horizon. As I gazed at the cracked landscape, I was reminded of mulch films I have read about in research papers, and felt the seeds of an alternative method to protect plants and vegetation. Aspiring to learn more, I reached out to a senior chemist, Mr. Long at Junyan Technology Development Company in Shenzhen China, and asked to intern as a student researcher in his lab focusing on biodegradable mulching film development.Liquid mulching films are formulations of degradable materials that can be directly sprayed on to the soil to form a thin film. My project involved water saving, weed control by using biomass and chemical polymer. I designed biodegradable liquid mulch formula and prepared samples and tested them through quantitative analysis.As I brought my samples to the local farmers and started explaining the benefits to them, they became eager to learn more about it. I was encouraged when I saw their faces light up. Unfortunately, many became disappointed when they learned how costly they would be. As I walked out of the scorching fields, I was also disappointed and saddened that I could not help the farmers. Then I began to ponder if there could be an economic and sustainable way to produce mulch film.What made the mulch film expensive were the polymers, and polyvinyl alcohol used as a binder in the process. So, what if we could use biomass materials such as wheat and corn stalks, peanut shells, and tree barks to cut the cost in half, but what about the binder? Then, one brisk morning, while jogging, I noticed trash cans containing food scraps to be composted sitting in a line on the street waiting to be picked up. Could recycled food scraps replace PVA and produce liquid mulching films? They were all polymers. Without bothering to change out of my running clothes, I rushed into the lab and tried out my new idea.As I continue to work towards an economically feasible and environmentally safe solution to the problem of water conservation, challenges still arise. For example, how to separate the oil from kitchen waste? After some thought, I contrived a plan. Using high temperature dissolving and then separation by cooling, I can remove oil from the kitchen waste. This removal not only solves kitchen waste pollution but also brings the cost down.These experiences while trying to develop mulching film have shaped my dream to do research in the future and further involve myself in the science community. I came to realize that chemistry is no longer an abstract word in my dictionary. I wish to pursue chemistry to affect a more sustainable and environmentally friendly farming industry.",
    "Supps": "题目：In the spirit of Emory's tradition of courageous inquiry, what question do you want to help answer and why?

This curiosity is what drives me everyday in order to figure out a way that we can travel deep into the universe. However, with our limited life expectancy, yet astronomically vast space to travel, we might never reach the border of the universe if there is one. We cannot give up though, and must think of new ways to reach this goal of traveling the universe. ;I think it is very likely that we can reach far into space if only we can change our point of view: “What if we encode our existence and transform our current life form into a digital form, and transmit the digital form via wave, so that we could decode and restore ourselves on the other end?” I think to myself, “Yes, this could be a possibility. However, what if the destination does not have the matter to build the human body? Where would the matter come from to make the restoration process happen?” My attention was then drawn to modern physics, “In the experiment of special relativity, matter can transform into energy via annihilation or fission, but what about the other way around?” Although the reverse is not confirmed possible, I find it intriguing knowing why it is not possible, or maybe actually possible. I therefore looked into research findings from top researchers in this field including Oliver Pike, Felix Mackenroth, and Edward Hill, and learned about the generation of protons and electrons through high energy photon collision. The protons and electrons would be the ingredients that can be used to synthesize matters. However, as I investigated further, I countered with questions such as “What would initiate the high energy photons?” and “What could be the mechanism to induce the synthesis of matter from protons and electrons?”My train of thought didn’t stop there even though, I never thought that breakthroughs could happen without having the most absurd questions asked or the most unorthodox scenarios considered. Thinking through such different scenarios and seeing the sequence of events provides me with opportunities to piece the puzzle together. Asking questions and engaging in vital dialogue is what will drive us forward into success, even potentially into further deep space exploration. Our universe is expanding and getting larger everyday, and what keeps me awake at night is visualizing what might be out there in the vastness of space. New elements, energies or even life may exist out in space and it is our duty to explore. There was a time when the earth was thought to be flat, just like there was a time when the world thought the sun revolved around the earth. By questioning and exploring our curiosities, we can build new knowledge and therefore a new world."

It was the first day of Chinese New Year, and as the most important and ceremonious festival in China, we never slept late, even after a night of revelry and celebration; instead, we dutifully arrived at a nearby temple to pray to Buddha.At the gate of Temple Mountain before the sunrise, there was already a large crowd of people moving to the temple slowly. Males, females, elderlies, children, disabled, or beggars. For one moment, they were no different, each with the same purpose, to burn joss-sticks and pray for good luck for the new year. I crossed the threshold carefully without touching or stumbling, because every misstep signified the number of difficulties I would encounter the coming year.At the temple, we ignited three joss sticks, kneeled down before every Buddha, and made three wishes for the new year. In front of the largest Buddha, I said, \"Please help my grandmother.\" This year, my grandmother suffered from hypertension, and I usually found her suffering with headaches.However, for the first time in 17 years, I came to a strange realization that I was bartering with Buddha: paying Buddha Joss-sticks and showing deference so Buddha will protect me and provide something in return. So was almost every visitor to the temple, who would not return here again until next year for the next praying for good fortune. While sitting on the stone seats outside the main temple hall, I wondered, \"When did Buddhism become a transaction?\"Many foreigners and even some Chinese criticize ourselves as an ethnicity without a belief, and truthfully, for most Chinese, religion is not a priority. We will not thank Buddha or other gods at an award ceremony, but rather thank parents, teachers, friends. Chinese people may discriminate against different regions and provinces, but never have prejudice against religions. Even a sacred tradition such as visiting a Buddhist temple has become a place for bartering, and where monks sell joss-sticks at expensive prices and convince people they are necessary for good fortune.When I was young, I went to my hometown by train with my grandma. I always remember that night, my grandma put her wallet, cell phone and all her valuables under her pillow and told me to do the same. At that moment, I looked around the train and felt that I was a child in a dark forest, while other people quietly waited like hungry animals, waiting to encroach on me. I became helpless and fearful. In a world where the only belief is that life is a competition where people must do anything to succeed, society becomes a dangerous and fraudulent place.There is a Buddhist scripture I read a year ago. The book was a collection of questions and answers between Buddha and his believers. His answers encouraged students to love the world and help others, and most importantly, Buddha wanted everyone to be responsible for his or her behavior, to restrain from evil for temporary happiness. Those answers were what made Buddhism, or broadly speaking, religions, powerful, because besides laws, spiritual belief can also influence human behavior. They provide principles of morality where there is no governance, so that even as a young child in a wild train alone, I would have no worries.When I left the temple, I made a decision to stop bartering with Buddha, not because of disbelief, but because of respect. Even if I am still atheist today, my experiences have taught me to appreciate true religion for providing moral guidance in society, and that appreciation starts with respecting Buddhism for its intrinsic values such as compassion, and not participating for self-benefit.",
    "Supps": "题目：What question do you want to help answer\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          \"How old are you?\" The recruiter at the firm asked. \"Sixteen,\" I said. \"So you haven't graduated from high school. What can you do then?\" I had been in charge of marketing at my school magazine, and wanted to gain more experiences in marketing through a winter internship. Unfortunately, during the interview, the recruiter hanged up the phone once I told her my age.More than a year ago, in Senior 1, our teacher gathered a group of student leaders and asked us to execute an activity plan she had made. Later, although we found problems with it and proposed our revised plan, she said because we were inexperienced, we should just obey her instructions instead of making changes to the plan.Various experiences like these made me ponder whether qualifications like experience, title, and age truly reflect people's capabilities. Can inexperienced young people like us, if placed in the real-world work environment, do as well as adults? Determined to prove that age is not the only indicator of a person's ability, I started a program in school to try to help talented high school students to find internships that are usually only available to adults.In this one-week research, we assigned students to various firms based on their interest, and throughout the process, we closely monitored how they worked, recorded their work performance from daily interviews with their manager, and tracked how they felt about the work experience. Our results showed 80% students enjoyed the internship experience and felt they had gained various skills and contributed to the firms; from the companies' side, 95% of the managers rated highly of students' performance.In one particular case, a talented programming student was assigned to work in a startup company as a Junior Programmer. After a brief training, he was asked to build a new website for the company, along with full-time programmers and designers. With his passion to coding and quick learning ability, he finished his work with high quality that even impressed those experience programmers.Another student was sent to a marketing department at an education institution, where his main responsibility was to advertise the company to residents of a community. He did thorough research on the community including family income, product preferences, and potential marketing channels. Gathering all information, he presented the marketing plan to the manager, who was surprised that a high school student could consider as comprehensively as professionals.This experience taught me that age has little to do with ability. In this program, young students performed as well as experienced professionals. While I admit that experience only comes with age and needs to be accumulated over time, it doesn't mean that young people should not start accumulating experience sooner. After seeing so many young students doing a good job in the real world, I believe that age should no longer be the reason to preclude young students from gaining valuable social experiences.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Optional Oxford Essay\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I still remember how surprised I felt when I learned Prisoner's Dilemma in economics class. It showed how two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears it is in their best interests. As I learned more about game theory and behavioral economics, I further studied the complex nature of decision making in economics, which has influenced me to consider human behavior and social interactions on a deeper level.Similarly, I am fond of history. To me, learning history not only means reading plenty of primary sources to know what has happened, but developing critical thinking skills that will help me analyze problems in a more comprehensive way. For example, in my studying European history, there are many figures like Cardinal Richelieu, who receives different or even contrasting reviews from his contemporaries and people later. Through the multitude of controversial viewpoints, history has taught me not to simply label \"good\" or \"bad\" to people, but to critically consider various angles.Inspired by these, I hope to fully learn social sciences and humanities in my first two years at Oxford because they constantly stimulate me to gain a deeper perception of people and society, beneficial for my goal to become an insightful, well-rounded individual.In particular, I am attracted by the innovative study approach \"Ways of Inquiry\" at Oxford. In such an environment, I will develop capabilities that transcend beyond simple memorization of knowledge by \"reading critically, communicating effectively, and pursuing knowledge independently.\" With this method, I will not only learn the fundamental concepts in economics and history, but also equip myself with tools to help me better self-study and explore new knowledge.At Oxford, I hope to understand the ways in which people, societies, and cultures interact in the world. Not limited in a certain discipline, I will be able to fully consider the factors that have shaped the past and influenced our current world. For example, I am fascinated to further learn how Nazi came to power in the early 20th century by analyzing the German culture, economics, and politics at that time. Besides, I hope to integrate my knowledge about US history and economics and have intellectual conversations with my Oxford peers to explore ways to further help US prosper.Besides academic pursuits, Oxford is my ideal choice also because of its unique emphasis on encouraging students to hone their leadership skills early on. From my various experiences as a student leader, I learned it is important to have an effective leader to inspire the team to achieve great. Through Leadership Oxford program, I hope to self-assess and discover my own leadership style and to see how leaders can be effective in diverse situations. From ExCEL, I envision myself participating in the challenging outdoor activities, to sharpen my understanding of ethical leadership and innovative problem solving.At Oxford, I know my goals to become a well-rounded scholar and future business leader will come true, and I can't wait to meet with my equally passionate Oxford students."

    "CommonApp": "Not again. It’s three in the morning! The kid on the bed next to me was screaming. It was my special treat for being the only patient on this floor who was taller than four feet and more than ten years old. But that wasn’t all. When sunlight came through the windows, kids started watching cartoons. Mickey was laughing. Donald was quacking. Homer’s “woohoo” kept ringing around me like a mosquito. Will this ever stop? It had been a month since I was hospitalized again. It all started in eighth grade when I was diagnosed with a lung disease called pneumothorax. It was like stunning thunder suddenly comes out in a shiny day. Coming out many whimsical thoughts, I went to search almost anything about this disease to eliminate my horrible guesses.Furthermore, my condition prevented me from doing what I loved, like basketball and tennis . My doctor told me not to exert myself. Lying on the bed, doing nothing, I started wondering what else I could do other than complain and sleep. As part of my recovery plan, I needed to blow up a balloon a few times a day to strengthen my lungs. . One day, while blowing up a balloon, my cheeks turned red. As I finished the  first balloon and gasped for air, I noticed the boy next to me looking at me eagerly, his bright eyes were focused on my balloon. Then, I held out the balloon to him. Clapping his hands, he took it out to play. At least, I could have some quiet time. Hearing their laugher outside, I wondered how these kids could laugh so easily. As I watched them play, I noticed their smiles and laughter as they chased, hit, and tried to catch the floating balloon. The sound was from the same kids who kept me awake at three in the morning, from the same kids that were stuck in this awful hospital with me.I know how it feels to stay in hospital, lying on the bed, tired of TV. The room starts to feel tiny and suffocating. Worse, patients there may not be able to wash their hair for days, and they cannot go to bathroom on their own. It’s hard even for an adult, let alone a kid of five or six years old. Nevertheless, these kids were still laughing with the balloon outside. How could they be having so much fun so easily when they were trapped in this dreadful place? I gradually came to realize that it was these kids teaching me a lesson, the supposedly more mature one.  Unlike me, these kids were creating joy, instead of complaining. I came to understand that complaints only made me feel worse. Why not stop complaining and try to enjoy what I could, despite the awful circumstances. Anyway, this disease, no matter how bad, wasn’t go away. I might as well make the most of things. When my back hurt one night, the boy next to my bed asked me to play with a balloon with him. “Couldn’t you see I was suffering from the pipe inside my body?” I thought. He wouldn’t stop until I agreed. Miraculously, after having begun to play, I didn’t feel that much pain. “I forget about the pain when I play with a balloon, so I thought it would work for you as well”, he said. He was right. I was so engrossed in my pain that I was ignoring the opportunity to feel joy. By me always thinking about my pain, it only become worse. Therefore, this kids taught me to facilitate joy rather than to neglect it. I came to understand the importance of  keeping a  positive mindset in lo places. I then decided to blow balloons for every kid on the floor. I realized that, in a small way, I could make this place a happier community connected by balloons, and I was determined to do it.For now, I am totally over the disease. But the lessons those kids taught me still stay with me. . No matter how bad a  situation  might be, I always approach it from a more optimistic angle. At least, I wouldn’t become gloomy because of breaking a bone. I would consider a chance to enjoy my newly bought New York Times bestseller. Like how those kids that created the joy in an awful place, I too have the ability to find lightheartedness and hope in whatever situation. One night in the hospital, hearing their laughter, mixed with voices from the cartoons, I slowly closed my eyes. While Donald’s quacking is still annoying. I felt more at ease with my place in the world.  “Hey, big bro, you have two options: playing balloons or watching Mickey with us.” The kid yelled by my bed. Well, I guess my plan for a comfortable nap could be put on hold.  “I think I can do both,” I said. ”",

    "CommonApp": "You should behave like a real girl. You shouldn't have to carry our own baggage\", a classmate commented as I dragged a large suitcase down 2 floors by myself.\"Why? I can do it myself.\"Ever since I was a little girl, I have experienced the disparity in gender roles. I still remember my very first roller coaster ride, the ticket checker asked my mother whether she was sure she wants me to try such a dangerous ride, while letting boys flood into the seats freely. While I was in the ride, I overheard some parents chatting with my mother, telling her how amazed they were because I was as courageous as their boys.For much of my childhood, I struggled with the notion of \"how a girl should act\". In China, there is an expectation for girls to be fragile, timid and gentle. It is very common that we are raised to expect protection and assistance from boys because we seemingly lack physical power.Fortunately for me, standards for the \"right way\" as a girl did not exist in my family. My parents had always told me, \"do not view yourself as a weak girl, do whatever you want\".Following their advice I went and did many things that would be considered \"unladylike\". Chasing my male classmates around in their silly game of \"building tag\", I would often be seen running up and down flights of stairs in middle school. When I couldn't find enough girls to play basketball I would convince the boys to let me play with them. By the time I finished middle school, I had more male friends than female friends.Hanging out with my male friends came with its benefits. I started learning more about electronics and computers as we played a lot of video games during our free time. I found myself replacing the boys in various roles, such as the being the person people would go to for computer help when they get the \"blue screen of death\". I was nominated to be the technical supervisor in my MUN club, in charge of all things related to video equipment and software tools, a role traditionally held by boys. I was able to complete creating the closing video for the MUN conference in less than 48 hours. Eventually, the concept that there was a relationship between gender and specific roles began to fade.While it is nice to be treated with extra courtesy, being offered help to carrying things, having the door opened for me, I simply prefer to do things myself. I've grown accustomed to finding solutions and solving difficult problems on my own, because the feeling of being independent and strong is liberating.As I reflected on my development as an \"unconventional\" girl, I had to admit how fortunate I am to have two loving parents that supported my interests. By not living in the frame of a traditional girl, I was able to gain skills and knowledge that I would not gain otherwise. I will continue living unconventionally and exploring all the exciting and interesting things girls are not supposed to do.",

From sketching with color pencils and paintbrushes to drawing with a mouse and keyboard on Photoshop, I don't remember ever taking a break from my most valued creative hobby. This past summer I attended the Carleton Computer Science Institute to learn about image processing and animation. Through this program I learned that the foundations of powerful software like Photoshop and Premiere were built upon numerous lines of codes. In college, I want to combine my interest in computer science and digital arts, so that one day I can work in the digital arts industry, creating software and applications that will inspire the next generation of artists.The Tandon school of engineering is the perfect place for me to do so. Majoring in Computer Science will allow me to build a strong foundation in understanding the theories and mechanisms behind digital arts technology, and investigate how mathematical computations and physics is transformed into the lines of codes that makes up such softwares. Meanwhile, I can take advantage of Tandon's unique resources in digital media education.By minoring in the Integrated Digital Media program, I will have the opportunities to further explore the field of graphics and geometric modeling, and gain practical skills in using a variety of digital media production technology. Courses such as Visual Foundations Studio (DM 1123) will allow me to practice using industry- standard software and the 3D Modeling (DM 2133) course series will allow me to develop my 3D animation skills that I touched upon at Carlton. Furthermore, through the IDM program there will be large amounts of internship opportunities from large media companies such as ABC network to production studios like Marvel Entertainment.In addition, working and researching in MAGNET (Media and Games Network) will accustom me to the real industry setting through working in a studio setting, using industry standard hardware and software, while collaborating in a social hub where I can network with students across disciplines. Courses and projects in the Game Innovation Lab will allow me to apply my programing and animation knowledge to good use.Whether I will become a 3D animator, a programmer working on virtual reality, or the software engineer creating the programs that allows animators and artists to express their creativity, NYU is the best place for me to unravel my future path."

    "CommonApp": "My heart jumped before I could. Hands clenched the protruding rock; feet dug into the cliff’s edge, towering above an abyss—I peeked at it. Oh God. I swallowed my anxiety, and focused on the solid ground two feet across from where I hung. The path behind me was easy to climb up but impossible to get down, so there’s no way back. Were my leap to fail, my life could end. And for the first time, I was seized by feelings of regret. If only I had known I’d be in this situation, I wouldn’t have chosen this route. My friend Anthea and I had walked on the pedestrian route leading to the famed King Arthur’s Throne at the mountain’s top, but I insisted we climb by an unmanned path. Excited, we knew the adventure would be unforgettable…just not this sort of unforgettable. Murphy’s Law, which states that “anything that can possibly go wrong, does”, which I’d often ridiculed, now bit back with a wily smirk. I breathed deeply, and relaxed—feet dug deeper, knees bent, hands released their clutch, and legs sprung my weight across the gap. Blood rushed to my brain as a sense of relief flowed through me and the right hand that managed to reach the ground across. Touchdown. But the soil underneath my feet was too soft. Dirt crumbled through my shoes, and I was almost in the air again. Seconds suspended felt like decades as I imagined my bleak end. I closed my eyes. Why had I always refused to conform to the conventional? Right, always. There I go. Little me, as bold as ever, climbing up the stairs to the top layer of a boat, and trying to capture the beautiful sunset. My mom’s worried eyes spotted me. Though my legs trembled in the sea wind, I couldn’t stifle my curiosity. I wanted to see. There’s another story. “This is not the way,” Mom’s cry echoed in the Lake District in Britain, as I turned left when we reached a crossroad where we were instructed to turn right. I did not want to give up on the opportunity to explore serendipities unfound in our travel guide. The left held the unknown, the unexamined, the curious call towards adventure; the right held its polar opposite. She acquiesced. Although we spent ten times the expected journey to our destination, we enjoyed the picturesque mountain views atop jagged rocks, and listened to the lake’s poetic scenery. Her words seemed more like a joke than a warning. But was I wrong this whole time? This was clearly not a joke. Curse you, Murphy. The moment when I was about to fall off the cliff, I regretted taking the mysterious route. Luckily, Anthea caught me in time, pulled and saved me. Her eyes beamed worry; sweat found my back instantly. Now safe, sound, and in one piece, I felt weighed down by my innate tendency to opt for the unknown. My long-held belief in life, that life is valuable only because I have lived the way I want to live, looked plainly reckless. I held myself responsible for not having thought things through. But if I were to accept life’s paved certainties and conform to the routes trekked by the majority, would I still stay true to my soul and be the girl who’s willing to create things that nobody has created and attempt the unattempted? No. I chose not to regret continuously paving new paths. Making and following my own choices made me know that I’m alive, with a heart accelerated with curiosity, uncertainty, and also life. My soul is free, and my heartbeats real. Next time I will be smarter, taking more into considerations and avoiding to be reckless. But since unexpected sceneries, serendipitous beauty and novel challenges have always been defining my life, I will keep on discovering them, to discover myself.",

I was coding an interactive, projector-powered game for a Youth Hotel in Shanghai, allowing patrons to use full-body motions to mimic projected images on a wall. We hoped it would break the ice among hostel dwellers and facilitate new connections. The error message seemed to make our goal more than just a summer SuperLab project; now, this was personal.  ;I glared back at the screen. Coding had only taken a day, but running and debugging the program had lasted seven—eight hours a day—and counting. My two teammates and I ate, argued, coded, hacked, and slept in a tiny hostel room, battling error after error, until the game's main function ran smoothly. We rejoiced, proud to have fought them all back in time to present it in the Maker Exhibition. The game was well-received, our tutor praising its practicality and creativity. I had tasted a sense of fulfillment from benefiting others beyond the several small projects that had facilitated fellow students’ lives.This Maker Workshop experience, coupled with my year-long project developing my school's homework assignment-collection system “SAM”, the Boxes, and Pragmatist Competition, crystallized my excitement for using technology and teamwork to solve real-world problems. This is why I long for a university that is both entrepreneurial and united—two of Carnage Mellon University’s (CMU) salient facets that drew me towards its College of Engineering.My longing first began with Pittsburgh’s community. Housing the best start-up scene in America's mid-East, this city attracts hundreds of new technological superstars seeking to start their ventures. I love the close connection CMU has built with this vibrant scene, including Game Salad, whose co-founder, Michael Agustin, prides his success to his alma matar, CMU. Possessing the strongest engineering department around Pittsburgh, CMU engineers dominate the start-up arena. There, I would easily gain internship opportunities to further explore ways to connect programming with hardware hacking and thrive as a bold entrepreneur.Teachers. Teammates. Creativity. Efficiency. And Courage. These qualities bloom throughout the College of Engineering at CMU, and they are actualized in independent research programs within Carnegie Mellon CyLab, where I would not only receive professional advice on how to improve my designs, but also integrate into a confident engineering community where talented peers challenge and learn from each other.Such a strong sense of community is most evident in CMU's rich “hacker” atmosphere. I am eager to engage with HackCMU, because I strongly identify with its competitive sports attitude. In CMU, being a hacker means being a creator; being a community member; and perhaps, being a mentor. Even as a prospective student, I feel encouraged to push my boundaries, take risks, and apply my computing skills to activities outside of my comfort zone, while steadily learning along the way. ;Four years—eating, arguing, coding, hacking, and sleeping—at CMU with life-long friends would be an exercise in passion and determination. ;"

    "CommonApp": "Acceptance doesn't come easy. Textbooks on my left, water bottle on my right, I was rushing to the study hall on a regular school day in America. I twisted my elbows and pushed the door with my knees with all the burdens in my hands. As I entered the classroom, suspicious eyes followed my every move. It was a young girl, looking at me, perplexed. She approached me with a question mark written on her face. “Do Chinese people eat frogs?” She asked. I was not sure if her tone was laced with skepticism or mockery. A rising blush on my cheek surfaced on my face.  The truth is; Chinese people eat frogs. Though they are not 'pond fresh', instead they are farm-raised. In fact, I enjoy lightly salted frog meat in a braised soup. I imagine that sounds queasy to non-Chinese ears. I hesitated and vacillated over my response, hoping to shrug off this awkward situation. I knew she was waiting for an answer.  I didn’t want her to see China abnormal, but I muffled an impulse to deny the truth. Why hide the real answer?“Yes, many Chinese people eat bullfrogs. It’s a regional food, though.” I responded in a light-hearted manner, hoping to explain my culture without leaving her feeling repelled. A dismissive smile flickered across her lips: “Don’t they smell gross? Do you eat them?”I knew the conversation was going downhill. Kids are like drunk people. They are brutally honest but lack tact.I responded, “I do. It isn’t nasty. It tastes like chicken.” She declared in a firm tone, “I probably wouldn’t eat that in my life.”I was trying to keep up my playful manner. “Chinese people are brave. If Adam were Chinese, he would have eaten the snake, and not Eve’s fruit. You know people in Florida eat alligators, and some Chinese think that is also different\" I said. Comes with my surprise, she nodded and ran back to her parents: “Interesting! I get it! I get it!”At that moment as the young girl walked away, I saw my family in her. Just like how every immigrating family began when first stepped arrive in a new land, my family was also struck by cultural shock. The first day at the hotel, my dad was at a loss. We always kept a tradition of drinking hot teas, and he realized that the room wasn’t equipped with a kettle.  He questioned me why Americans prefer cold water over hot water, and wonder why such an advanced country doesn't know the health benefits of warm liquids. For me, accepting new ideas and adapting to new culture did not come with the same difficulty as my father. Within a school environment,  I had the opportunities to socialize and adjust to Westerns. For my dad, with my dad's lack of fluency in English, cultural differences were akin to walls that coop him up in that little house. Living in a state of seclusion, my Dad couldn’t go to supermarkets to fulfill daily needs without the driver’s license. At that period, I had an epiphany perhaps I can be the cultural ambassador and help my parents stride over that cultural wall. First my task was to help my dad receive his driver license, passing the test in English. Regardless of grammar tense, but only focusing on the simplest way to extrapolate meanings from keywords, step-to-step explanation was the method I chose to approach my goal. The process was time-consuming, but I felt a sense of fulfillment when my dad drove home alone. I don't mind putting on my part-time cultural ambassador hat. It does not require merely recognizing differences, but I feel it requires understanding, explanation, patience, and time. But doesn’t this worth our effort and eventually turns us to become better individuals?",
    "Supps": "题目：In the spirit of Emory's tradition of courageous inquiry, what question do you want to help answer and why? (500 word limit)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          The mother clasps her child in her arms with tears in her eyes. Her child, with leukemia, lost all his hair due to chemotherapy. The mother is praying that the God would give him a second chance in life, but at the same time feeling helpless toward her affordability of carrying out Bone marrow transplants for the child and the chance of surviving after the treatment. This is the first image that was deeply branded in my mind when I was holding the Careholic Association project in helping children with leukemia. There are, however, millions of people giving up medical treatments because of financial problems. ;Just recently in Atlanta, Trans-Pacific Partnership between twelve countries was officially signed after years of negotiation. While many people focus on the how the elimination of tariff would impact on the domestic economy, I, on the other hand, was startled by the fact that more than 40,000 Vietnamese patients will have to stop taking the antiretroviral medicines used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS as a result of the proposed expanded patent protections. Extending the patent means more profit to the pharmaceutical companies because companies can enjoy the monopoly over its products for a longer period of time, but also means that patients’ choice of taking affordable generic drugs, which the price is 20% of that of original, is bereft. That image of the mother clasping her child in arms re-emerges in my head, and I start to wonder that trade-off between “profit” and “people”, and whether or not, is there a solution to eliminate the problem of “Trading ‘Profit’ over ‘People’”, or is there a way that both encourages the exploration of new frontiers in science and maximizes patients’ benefits?This is the question that I want to answer. I want to find out a way to achieve the social maximization because two goals are indeed conflicted, and the problem is how to find that balance. Learning from my mother who is working as a Vice President in one of the top pharmaceutical companies, I understand how difficult and costly the process of the development of medicine is, as if scientists are searching for paths through a labyrinth. Scientists never know the drug candidate even after millions of experiments. Not only the uncertainty, but also the time and people involved in the whole process make the research and development of medicine a costly task. If the medicine were luckily approved to launch, gaining profit during period of patent would be the only way to leverage the future R&D and encourage innovations. ;The debate over the extended patent protections nowadays seems to focus simply on profit rather than patient. Indeed, profit is the motivation of scientific innovations, but it is time for companies to take on that social responsibility on patients in order to find that balance. Companies can possibly implement suitable patient affordability program to help these patients.

    "CommonApp": "Afternoon that smell like clean linen. Dusk was settling in, and shadows began stretching across the room. It were only Erri, the president of National Honour Society, and I.“Oliver, regardless what others are saying, just chase after honour defined by your heart.” She drew a hand, pointing to my heart.I stiffened slightly. There was another sound saying in my heart.Really?During my elementary school, my honour code was be better than others: I always answered teachers’ questions quicker,which was beyond their expectation ;My homework was always done with good quality,which won me great academic records; at times to donate money for charity,the amount of money I gave in always exceeded two digits. In order to have edges over others, I always forced myself to improve.I simply couldn’t let others stand in front of me after all.However, I ceased to feel content for just being above average briefly. My honour code quickly changed to be the strongest. Instead of finishing some basic homework, I would always ask teachers to give me tough questions. In every group competition, I would like to group myself with people who were unlikely to win. So I could show the weak that my participation could actually reverse their fate. Although competing with the tops and do tough questions actually didn’t help me improve my marks, I didn’t care. My great confidence denied anything impossible. I thought  as long as I had worked out more questions than the tops had, I could pave my way straight into the best class in the best high school and even ranked the first. At that time, I would be immersed with others’ compliments and applauds. The eagerness to prove myself and be the best totally occupied me.In my mind, I stubbornly felt that my honour should be derived from comparing with the tops.Although the dreams had propelled me to devote remitting effort on tough questions, I forgot to review the basics. The Achilles' Heel eventually made me fall 100 feet without anything underneath. I was not even qualified to go to my dream school.  I clearly remembered how I got through that sultry and afflicting summer. The vain brought by the great failure made me feel like being a kite runner who jumped high, in an effort to catch the gold  kite in the sky. I held my breath and open my hands. Suddenly, I stiffened. My arms were not long enough! The realization came too late for me to react. In a split of second, desperately, I hang in the air, watching the beautiful kite drifting away. With a fruitless catch, I fell on the ground hard and ate a mouthful of mud.After my great confidence was shattered into pieces, I was deeply trapped in the marsh of diffidence. At the beginning of my journey in Maple Leaf, rather than be as confident as before ,I chose to be quiet. I forgo the class president election which I was good at. I flinched in the front of group presentation.I used to be fearless, but now I was not only tired of bearing others’ expectations but also afraid of experiencing a great downfall again from the top.The thought that I was not qualified to be the tops daunted me from adhering to my original honour code . Additionally, the new education system prevented me from comparing with the tops by concealing others’ marks. I could only do was shifting my whole attention on my studying. Surprisingly, I felt comfortable without looking around. At the end of the semester, I was ranked 4 in academy at school.With the boom in my academic performances, I started to believe maybe I was not the worst. What if this was a coincidence? What if this was done by pure luck? So I decided to find out more proves. I started to get myself involved into some school activities, such as Basket Boy, English Art Festival and Christmas Party.With my name spreading on the campus, my confidence was gradually mounted up. Somewhere in my heart started to get itchy. I know, the notion of comparing with others and being the best returned. The eagerness to be superior kept scratching my heart.However, instead of chasing after honour blindly like before. I began to question the essence of different honour.There were too many things appealing honourable to me, but which one was the true honour to chase after? Then I met Erri. In that cozy afternoon, she told me her interpretation of honour.Somehow her words point out the direction, but what she told me totally contradicted what I had believed for so long. Was my old honour code really wrong? I didn’t get much time to struggle for the real difference between the two “honour” before I was presented with problems .At the end of the semester, I was offered to be either the leader of the student union or the president of NHS. These two options were wrestling in my head. According to the school policy, I just had one option. I simply could not give up the fame derived from being the leader of the union. However, denying all the values that the club has taught me sounds insane. The former hugged me from the back, tempting: “ Choose me! Then you will get the honour that everyone envies.” The latter touched my cheek, whispering: “The club has inspired you so much about honour.You would not make your own honour disappointed, wouldn’t you?”It was no doubt for the past me to choose the former. But whenever I touched the first option, my heart felt painful, as if it was trying to remind me of the failures caused by pursuing everybody’s honour. You always have time to do it right again, I said to myself. At that moment, I made a bold decision. I chose to say no the past me.I was proud for myself for choosing the latter initially. However,my courageous decision didn’t bring me good luck. I quickly found out that the club which I chose to be the leader of was hardly ever known by the school leaders. My predecessors failed to win principle’s recognition because her projects violated the school polices. I decide to change the principle’s impression towards the club, but hesitation and worries deterred me.What if I became too nervous and forgot what to say? What if the principle simply refused me and kicked me out? I worried a lot indeed, maybe what waited ahead of me was adversity, but how could I scruple if I want to pursue my honour?I remembered clearly how I started my gambit with a slightly trebling voice. What maked the thing worse was that I found out the principle didn’t pay any attention on me. For a moment, I was overwhelmed by defeatism. I wanted to run out of the cold office as soon as possible. However, there was a sound saying: “Oliver, if you give up, you would never know what kind of honour you would get in the end.It is your own honour after all.No! I heard myself denied automatically. For the sake of my own honour, I simply couldn’t lose! Thus, I raised my tone of speaking suddenly. The principle looked up. I caught his sight in the air. Instantaneously, I knew it was my turn to inverse the situation. From the history of the club to its prospect, from the club structure to its members information，I found I gradually got his attention.When I talked about what value could the club bring to school, he took done notes. Especially when I elaborate the central pillar of the club—the definition of honour, he directly fixed his eyes on me.No longer feel pressure, I devoted all myself into the passion for my club. I felt nothing except my blood thrashing through my body.When the time I finished, the wave of passion still hasn’t subside in my heart. Nevertheless, the atmosphere once again dropped into dreaded silence.He stood up. I saw a flashing of smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. He opened his mouth slowly, seemed to gather enough strength to stress every word in the next sentence he was going to say“ Good job, young man. Let’s see what you will get.”An ecstasy hit me. For a moment, I believed I cried.You are right, Sir. let me show you what I will get.I promoted solidarity in the club first, in an effort to unit all the members under my lead. I cut down some unnecessary spending to save some money for the future group project. With abundant budget and a good team, I started to “conquer the campus”. I quickly encountered intense competition. I realised as a leader I should let my members rely on their own discretion instead of being bossy.So I chose to give other members opportunities to run different projects. So our every project would be different that the other The more diverse my club was, the more advantageous it become.  Also, facing complicated restrictions set by the school in terms of running activities, I didn’t resign. I chose to use wits to argue with the school leaders for approval. I wrote petition and affidavit. I used my affliction with teaching department to gain rights to protest and urge changes. In order to tackle the low awareness of my club among students, I got my club participated into all kind of school activities: Sports meeting,  Halloween Party, Christmas show.  After 4 months，no one had still remembered there was once a club, due to a lack of leadership, was suffering from a low attendant rate and zero recognition from the school leader On the contrary, the club now is rising to be the symbol of the school from the sponsor of the school library to the reviver of the English Corner; from the harbinger of the Teacher Professional development to the preacher of the confusion of the both Western and Chinese culture. From the activity enthusiast to the paradigms of academic performances, the club clearly wrote down glories in Maple Leaf History.Moreover, I created a lot of “ the first” on campus. This is the first club which has built a library for a poor village in Chinese rural place; this is the first club which has carried huge amount of money and taken a bus to somewhere 200km far to fond a dog house; this is the first club which  has constructed a platform between teachers and students in which they can further interact by helping each other in the daily life; this is the first club which has  became the business card of the school to attract new members.The impacted brought by my club even exceeded the Student Union at school.Sometimes I wondered what if I was given another chance, would I change my decision of being a unknown-to-everybody club leader again? The answer was yes. As the leader of the club, on the one hand, I have reconstructed and revived the club; on the other hand, the club has built something inspiring in my heart. I have been put in front of many difficulties; I have been presented with countless dilemmas. I couldn’t remember how many times did I fall, nor could I count how many failures did I admit. But, but, there was no time, not single time, did I ever think about giving up. I felt strange for my persistence at first. However, after I ruminated what Erri had told me before, I found the reason. It was something profound instead of ethereal. It was something fundamental instead of temporary. It gave me courage and confidence which enabled me overcome hardship; it provided me with composure when I was crashed by the reality. I couldn’t care less for the extrinsic value since it was so infinitesimal when it was compared with the self-satisfaction brought by my belief. I adhered to my  own honour, that was my credence. That was the reason I chose to be the leader of the club. My honour directed me to a bright future.When I was granted the title of “The Most Influential Maple Leafer”. In that grand ceremony, I stood in the rostrum, wearing a colourful garland, holding a crystal trophy which reflected the purified sunshine. Thousands of students stood below me, silently, waiting to hear my words. They were all eager to hear how could I obtain such honour.I held up the microphone to my mouth, thinking what to say. For a split of seconds, the world in front me went blank. There was only one person in my eyesight. That was me.The “me” who stumbled at the great failure but never succumb; the “me” who sequestered from the crowds and focused on academy; the “me” who reappeared on the stage and be prepared to be the president to chase his own honour.All the events flashed through my eyes. I wanted to grasp some pieces from the stream, but they all fade from my mind.However, there was one thing that didn’t fade. Suddenly, I know what to say next.\"My honour code is to pursue my own honour. That is reason why I stand here.",

Despite my confidence in myself as a fluent English speaker, I could still feel the great cultural difference when situated in foreign land. The same awkwardness also appeared on the face of my Canadian teachers. In order to bridge the gap between local students and foreign teachers, in Grade 11, NHS under my leadership launched the first student-help-teacher activity.  ;From Chinese history to rudimentary pronunciation of mandarin, we “trained” our foreign teachers in various aspects. With no previous experience to draw on, sometimes I was haunted by pressure. I kept thinking about how to be a good representative of the student before lecturing in the Professional Development. Translation of terminology in historical and cultural fields was another obstacle we had to overcome. Nevertheless, as foreign teachers got ever more received in class and their mastery of Chinese vocabulary and culture got even better, I was delighted to see the two hugely different cultures began to integrate under my “match”.Because of my dedication, Teacher Professional Development Program has become the most distinctive interactive platform between teachers and students in the Maple campus. I know in the era of massive cultural exchanges, what I have done is a small step, but I am fully prepared to do more in the future.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Students learn both inside and outside the classroom. What would other members of Carolina community learn from you?

Other teams were celebrating success--riverside marathon held by Student Union gained sponsorship from Coca Cola, and charity performance for autistic children organized by School Voluntary Club received awards from Wuhan Voluntary Association. ;Although I was happy for the success of other groups, I couldn’t help feeling beaten down as I desperately tried to dissuade students from quitting school. “Did we fail?” asked Debbie, whom I appointed as vice president of our NHS club. I had to admit, judging by our current results, we were far from success. With the district’s neglect of education, the attending students had dropped from 30 to 10 within only 15 days, and a water crisis caused by high temperatures made everyone dehydrated. Worse still, my plan of building a library for the school was postponed for lack of support from local government. It seemed failure loomed behind all the ominous signs. But did this also mean that our efforts to create educational opportunities for these disadvantaged students were futile? Was result the only standard of success? I urged myself to search for the answer while hanging on.In an effort to reach the students who were dropping out, I gathered personal information on every child and paid them a visit one by one, crossing muddy roads and deserted fields. Then I redecorated the discarded classroom wherein I built the first library in Jiujiahu district. Every day I blogged about my small daily progress and contributed articles to local news agencies. In this way, I finally drew the attention and donations from the community. In the sleepless and scorching summer nights, my friends and I encouraged each other, telling jokes to temporarily forget the heat.By positively adjusting my expectations and approaches, I eventually made some “small” progress: instead of abandoning the project, my team ended up staying for more than two months. Besides teaching kids how to draw animals and sing songs, we managed to insert real knowledge like biology and physics into our curriculum. Gradually kids returned to our class, and we found ourselves enjoying teaching, enjoying the kids’ smiles, and enjoying hearing them say “Good morning, teacher!” Though what we had achieved in the end was not remarkable by most people’s standards, we never felt so successful. ;At the end of August when our team returned to Wuhan, sunburned, without praise or award, we couldn’t be more satisfied and proud of what we had achieved. Thanks to this experience, I believe I can answer the question: true success comes from self-growth and contribution. While few outside of our small project will notice our efforts, we managed to brighten the summer of a few children. If admitted to Carolina Community, I believe I could share not only my gain in voluntary teaching, but the whole significance of continuous exploration and demonstration of success."

    "CommonApp": "Since my childhood, I was praised because of my genius for mathematics. At school, I was always lucky to be enrolled in “Math Class”, the so-called “intensive training class”. Besides, I achieved good grades in all the quiz and examination. I indulged myself in the pride of being No. 1 and the happiness of being admired.As an elite student, I was endowed with more chances to compete and fight for the honor of the class, even for the school. This year, I was chosen to participate in the training of China Olympic Mathematics National Team for my excellence, which was tailored for teenagers with gift in mathematics and benefited my application for famous universities. Before leaving for there, I made up my mind to make full use of every minute to do exercises in case of falling behind and seize the only six opportunity of participating in the IMO. As expected, the moment I stepped into the classroom, each of them was buried in their test paper attentively with teachers sitting at the back of the room. The depressing atmosphere gripped my heart. I was arranged to sit beside a “legendary” member, who took part in various competitions and won numerous awards. Since we need to take six round of testing to determine the ranking, I spent most of my time on “rote learning”, constantly doing exercise. When the first examination began, I caught a glimpse of my desk mate speeding his pen while I racked my brain. On one hand I was eager to show my capacity, on the other hand I was too nervous to do well. To my disappointment, after the third round of testing, I was at the bottom of the list. Every time, my parents asked me about the results and ranking, I choked with sobs, stumbled over the answer. Perplexed by depression and bitter for two weeks, I was almost beaten by “failure”. I no longer give any thought to ranking and only involve myself in brainstorming when we were faced with a super problem. To my surprise, all the members encouraged me to express my opinions when discussing, which brought me comfort and confidence. Observing besides, I found that they didn’t consider the others as competitors and they were just interchanging their solutions and ideas. Their eyes sparkled every time they were amazed by others’ wonderful thinking. Some of them even dissected their wrong methods, explaining why they were confused without bashfulness. I was influenced by their generosity and integrated into this community, reflecting on my advantages and disadvantages. Immersed in this intense learning atmosphere, I conquered my self-abasement and finished self-positioning. Maybe, some of them were superior to me while the others were inferior to me, but they were all fans of mathematics who devoted themselves to continuous delving. Suddenly it dawned on me that I first came here out of my passion for mathematics instead of defeating myself with “ranking”. Therefore, I decided to get myself adjusted by maximizing my strength and minimizing my shortcomings. In the following weeks, I made my best to communicate with the teachers and solve the problems from a different angle. At the end of the training, I ranked 10th of the 60 members, which was a great success and progress for me. When my parents got the news, they both felt proud of me due to my persistence and counterattack. I finally realized that my obsession with mathematics was not deprived from prizes and accomplishment brought by it, but the pleasure of exploring the unknown. Moreover, my learning attitude was fickle and I should get to the bottom of the principles of mathematics. Although I am preparing for my application for American universities now, I will still strive for the 2016 IMO for my responsibility for my school and my fanaticism for progressing in the world of mathematics.",

    "CommonApp": "The clouds gradually gather, turning the sky a little darker, and the rain begins to fall softly and steadily. I stand in front of the glimmering glass window of the China World Trade Center Tower, holding a file of business news releases for my internship in an Exposition company. Outside the window, I see Beijing's Hutongs, where the houses are hundreds of years old and accessible only by a maze of alleyways. The rain seems to increase the thickening darkness of the alleys, to soften both the city's and my fading history. I recall my childhood in this maze, the ten year old little girl in a silk, frilled skirt bicycling past a pair of stone lions guarding a red, ramshackle door. People around her either amble along the narrow lanes or gather beneath gnarled pine trees, playing card games and complaining about the rising price of vegetables. The walled-in community, composed of old grey brick houses, circumscribes the people's view of the world and prevents them from dreaming big. People living in Hutongs lead tranquil but mundane lives; nearly every adult around me follows the unchanging formula of life, generation by generation. However, as a child, I had always wondered about the world outside the walls formed by the alleyways. I loved my neighbors and the old Beijing community laden with history, but I was more captivated by a world full of challenges and surprises, a world beyond the walls where people were not afraid to pursue their dreams. I asked myself: did I want to repeat this ordinary daily routine again? I heard my inner self saying steadfastly, \"No! I want to see the bigger world, to see what life has to offer\". In an attempt to experience and explore the larger world, I began to travel. I learned about Galileo's tenacious pursuit of truth and bravery in times of persecution when I visited the Leaning Tower of Pisa; I learned about Thomas Jefferson's hardships while drafting the \"Declaration of Independence\" when I was in Virginia; I learned about Napoleon Bonaparte's aspiration to unite the French when I strolled down the hallways of Versailles. An amazing truth gleaned from my travels is that all these heroic figures did not travel the same road to success, but they all lived their lives passionately and never let opportunity pass. As I traveled more, I also met many ordinary people who lived their lives with vigor and appreciation. Every person I met with a meaningful life story encouraged me to bravely find my own path for life and not just to copy the repetitive plot in the hundred years old Hutong alleyways. Such spirit also motivated me to step beyond the familiar and journey to California for high school, where I would not only develop a global perspective but also experience different cultures. So now, I begin to regard my future as my legacy, even before I decide if I should devote myself to protecting the fading traditional Chinese culture or dedicate myself to a career promoting cultural understanding between different countries. I do not know if I will become an accomplished writer who publishes influential cultural analytics books or a successful business entrepreneur who wants to help poor children and tell them that life is worth hard work and expectation. Nevertheless, no matter what path I choose, I will continue to work diligently and always remain impassioned about my life, for I want to embrace all the possibilities of my future. The rain outside the window grows heavier. I glance back to the Hutongs, realizing that no matter how much time goes by, those timeworn alleyways and lifestyles will never change. However, life is beautiful because of its uncertainties and constant challenges. Success is obtained by those who are passionate towards life and willing to take risks. Therefore, I am embarking on my new journey, never to return the same.",

Being able to obtain a solid liberal arts education in NYU with proximity to world-class museums and pubic arts is crucial to me because these experiences broaden my perspective and enrich my mind. ;Walking down Broadway, I join a swarm of lively NYU students switching classes.

Anticipating my appointment about internship opportunities in one of the top institutions in the city with my counselor later in the afternoon, I am aware that NYU brings inspiration to my life and provides me with exposure to real world opportunities. ;As I leave my class, I go straight to the charming Washington Square Park for lunch. Sitting on the benches, I love to appreciate the artistic works of people from all over the world. Enthusiastic about city life, I enjoy the unique ;NYU experience in which I can learn in an environment that transitions between the campus and the city. This enables me to understand more about American culture each and every day. ;After lunch, I go to my \"Social Media and Digital Marketing Analytics\" class, and then hide myself in the maze of Bobst library. While working diligently on my Economics homework and immersing myself in the world of marketing and data, I am grateful that NYU enables me to learn from prestigious economists such as Thomas J. Sargent. ;I am anxiously waiting for the day when I can see the Empire State Building lit in purple during NYU's graduation week and proudly adorn my car with a license plate frame reading \"Alumni / New York University\" in purple letters. NYU, one of the most inspiring, global communities in the world, is truly a place where I will only grow and learn, face challenges and embrace all the possibilities, but live passionately and fully."

    "CommonApp": "My experience with Christianity began when a Korean family next door invited me to their church and introduced me to Sunday School, a place with a friendly atmosphere and tasty Jell-O snacks. Whenever the teachers asked any questions, countless hands shot up, with some kids even shouting out their answers. At age nine, Sunday School became somehow even better, more like a seminar to discuss big themes – life, love, and faith. Unlike in Chinese middle school, our teacher actually encouraged us to give out whatever we were thinking, even contrary opinions. Class went beyond simple religious teaching to provide moral introduction and give us permission of giving out challenging words. It quickly became my dream to be a Sunday School teacher. But when I turned thirteen and began attending Tuesday night discussion groups with adults in church, everyone around the circle was always expressionless. One of my first times, we were discussing the verse \"If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also.\" For me, considering the whole context, it seemed obvious that these words teach us to avoid violence, to love and to forgive. Yet before I was able to speak out, an old man sitting next to me jumped in and interpreted the verse as that Christians should be acquiescent. Though I argued my thoughts, there was a huge silence before a woman countered using another Bible verse, \"Whoever is from God hears the words of God\" – a verse invoked often to defend literal interpretations. These people around the circle, like the Pharisees, stuck to the Bible so literally that they reminded me of the red guards quoting words from Chairman Mao. Yes, they know well the Bible, but what bothered me was they didn't seem interested in alternative interpretations. Entering the discussion group as an \"adult,\" I was disappointed to discover my earlier naiveté: my church, it turned out, was not perfect. While Sunday School provided me with moral education and an introduction to critical thoughts, the church wasn't as open to changes and contrary voices. For a while, I thought of going to a different church. But then, I spent one summer in the US working at a YMCA children's camp. Unfamiliarity to the tasks didn't stop me from getting close to the kids; we could play hide-and- seek together, and I read stories to them. Through these activities, I realized I could pass out my views and values to the kids. It took traveling across the world to realize that I could come back to Sunday School as a teaching assistant, the kind who could advocate critical thinking. Every coin has two sides. Thinking critically about the institutions we participate in is always necessary, as it never works only looking at a good side. This critical approach to my church can also be applied to every ideology—political, philosophical or otherwise. The existence of the flaws in fact brought me closer to my church. It's quite natural that the church is not perfect, so I chose to come back and be the one who is different, promoting what I believe essential. When I teach Sunday School now, during snack time, I suggest that my kids share their food so that they can taste different kinds. I talk to the ones who complain when they don't get food in return. I am an audience to their very valid concerns, but I also encourage them to consider what it might feel like to think about others before themselves. I am careful to strike a balance between encouraging their dissent and guiding them morally. They might not understand or remember precisely what I am getting at. But at least I can offer them the experience I cherished so that when their memories of Sunday School fade, they remember the friendly atmosphere where they challenged and were challenged by a nice girl who kept them company: me.",

This meaningful dialogue has taught me to respect different opinions. ;Outside of school, I taught a workshop on media reporting and journalism to a class of primary school students who aspire to become a journalist someday.

    "CommonApp": "Since I was young, my mother had control of everything in my life. From homework, to friends I hung out with, to what I ate for dinner, everything was planned and organized. To be honest, I secretly enjoyed that, because due to her strictness, I was always the student with the best grades. My father, on the other hand, spent most of his time away from home because of business. Despite not having both parents around all the time, I had a very happy childhood.Maybe I relied on my mother too much, but when she left after a car accident, I felt like the world came to an end. Overnight, the family I was familiar with disappeared, leaving only my father and me to continue; my father, who was born with an adventurous spirit, had to give it all up so he could stay home to raise me.In the beginning, I knew it was difficult for him. He was never known for his tidiness but he had to learn to be organized for both of us. Just cooking rice was a challenging task for someone who had never cooked in his life and sometimes, before I went to bed, I would find him reading some instruction manual, trying to fix the broken refrigerator or other equipment. Many times, he would be multitasking, answering business phone calls while making dinner for us.My father was not the only one who changed. Since entering middle school, thanks to the understanding of school's teachers I have been allowed to attend teacher conferences alone. Knowing that my father would not have time to check my homework, I became best friends with teachers and senior classmates, going to them for all my questions. To keep myself healthy, I even started to workout and swim. Eventually I became a triathlete and even one of the best American football players in the region.However, my father was a quiet man, so we did not have many deep conversations as my mother and I used to do. Both of us were learning about each other and trying our best to be a family, but it just wasn't the same without mother.Last year, I took part of the International Triathlon Tournament in Beijing. Not only was it the first time that I was qualified for such an event, but it was also the first time my father attended one of my events.Despite all the training, it was the most difficult thing I have ever attempted: whether it was the 1.5-kilometer swimming or the 40-kilometer biking, the thought of giving up kept entering my mind. As I started the last part of the 10-kilometer run I saw my father waiting patiently with his camera, hours after the race started, just to capture moments of me. Watching him tolerate the fierce sun to support me gave me new determination to finish the competition and after the race, I hugged him by instinct. That was the first time I hugged him since starting high school.I realized that although my father will never fill my mother's place and love me like she did, it was not because he loves me less. It was only that he had a different way of showing love, which was through quiet support and care. In that way, he has done his best all these years to make up for her absence and I am very thankful. In return, I try to give him my full support. Whether it's cleaning the house together or helping with post-production editing for his business's advertisements, we make a good team. We might not meet the traditional definition of a perfect family, but we have found ways to care for and support each other. I hope my mother, who maybe secretly watching us in heaven, is proud of what we have accomplished.",

With this random video on Youtube, my first time seeing Carleton students really caught my attention.The Silent Dance Party plus some research showed me how students here always do things passionately, whether it's pursuing their academic interests all night or dancing in the library. As someone who always wants to live a fulfilled life through following different interests, I found a reflection of myself in those students. That's when I knew Carleton, with its strong academics and extracurricular atmosphere, was right for me.A film enthusiast who read books like Histoire Du Cinema in his spare time, in the Cinema & Media Studies major I can learn many concepts and theories to better understand works from old classics to contemporary industry leaders. In classes like Advanced Production Workshop, I will keep improving my directing and editing skills. Outside of class, I'm excited to join Carleton League of Independent Filmmakers, where I can gain more hands-on experience as well as discuss filmmaking with other talented classmates.As a sports fan, I will undoubtedly go for the Carleton Knights football team tryouts.

I love this sport not only for the thrill but also because it gave me confidence and determination to take on challenges fearlessly.4 years ago, overweight, nearsighted, I joined school football team out of curiosity. Although scared even of the coming spiral ball, I decided to keep trying my best. I became the first to show up at each practice, training enthusiastically each time. Every small achievement made me want more, from the first time I won a snap to scoring my first touchdown. Seeing myself improve into a strong player empowered me, making me realize that I can achieve great things through hard work and determination. This encouraged me to pick up new interests like triathlon, while putting even more efforts into studying and film editing.Now, with perseverance I've learned from football, I am ready for a challenging but way more interesting future."

    "CommonApp": "As a little girl, I used to travel to the countryside with my grandparents because my parents were often busy. My childhood memories consisted of a few boys and girls squatting on the ground next to me, carefully observing “food” in a “pot”. The pot was actually just a pile of tiles and bricks, and our food was no more impressive – unripe fruit handpicked from trees. We were sometimes scared by the “raging fire” but then laughed at our silliness. Despite the limitation of our entertainment, we were never jaded by the game. That was my first introduction to “cooking”, and the make-believe pastime fostered my interest for the real deal. I decided that I needed a teacher, and there was no one more suitable than Waipo, my grandma. When she went to the supermarket, I followed. When she cooked meals for the family, I watched. When she taught me a delicious new recipe, I memorized it by heart. In many of my summer holidays, she taught me how to cook traditional Chinese dishes step by step, such as the simple but classic tomato and egg soup.“We need to fry the tomatoes first before making the soup dear.”“Why?”“Because it will look more glossy when the juice inside the tomatoes comes out!”“Should we add the salt?” I asked excitedly.“Not yet! When it’s time, I will tell you.”However, the stories between Waipo and I didn’t stay so picture-perfect. As I grew up, I started noticing that I didn’t quite enjoy Waipo’s style of cooking because everything felt messy and complex, with random ingredients thrown in together. For instance, Waipo would add odd vegetables or meats into traditional soups, intrinsically changing the natural flavors that I used to love. Soon after, I founded the cooking club: Culture of Delicacy. We brought in equipment to school and spent countless hours studying different food recipes and perfecting our skills. The process wasn’t easy though: in my high school, academic clubs are seen as more valuable experiences than non-academic ones. In fact, very few non-academic ones even make the cut to be opened. Still, I wanted to venture beyond our usual MUN or debate clubs. While they have their merits, I saw that participating in other extracurricular activities could also be worthwhile outside of academic acknowledgement and awards. I wanted to add my own twist to the recipe of my school's academic life.Sometimes the lack of school support sways me to give up. However, every time I see club members cooperating to complete a Chinese dish, I imagine them carrying forward our recipes in their college lives, cooking together in dormitories. Thinking about the stages we have reached, I am proud of our accomplishments.And just as my Waipo would diverge from the traditional style she was raised with, I began to develop a cooking style different from hers. Each time I chose to venture in a different direction, I had an internal debate, unable to shake off the feeling that perhaps my cooking method was wrong. More and more though, I kept practicing at it, maintaining a light touch in flavors and only adding in extra ingredients after much thought. With time, my dishes took on a life of their own through my new direction. I started realizing that there were no norms or rules in the field of home-cooked meals; it was just a difference in perspective. I took this lesson to heart. Today, I have become more confident in my cooking style. I could spend a whole morning preparing a dish, from buying fresh, raw ingredients to constantly stirring the pot for a perfect broth. For this morning? I made a traditional Chinese dish: a large meatball lying with a head of cabbage. This is my first independent success in the kitchen, ready to be shared with Waipo.My masterpiece — The Head of the Lion.",

I thought it’d be similar to traditional Chinese dance, something I had done in junior high…only, in a swimming pool. I quickly realized my assumptions might have been too simple. Water aerobics require uniformity and synchronization in almost every aspect of our gestures in order to create that artistic design in the water. While for dancing, I viewed the process more as the act of telling a meaningful story, with each dancer as an individual character.Jumping into the swimming pool for nationals last year, I was no longer that curious and nervous girl who first signed up. In that moment, I was in maximum concentration, mind and muscles trained for the demands of our performance.3…2…1…Time for my cue of confidence."

    "CommonApp": "The French musical “Notre Dame de Paris” was confusing for a 6-year-old. Why would a holy priest feel such passion for a Bohemian girl or why did medieval people wear blue jeans and danced in that vivacious way? Yet, I never felt lost when hearing Quasimodo’s hopeless ardor in deep vocal notes or the growing awareness inside Esmeralda in the humming wave of violins. Since that first experience with musicals, I have continued to explore the depth of emotions in other operas including La traviata, the Magic flute, and Der Ring Des Nibelungen. I can still feel confused about the plot, but I know that the arias of Addio, del passato bei sogni ridenti is where I will find the secret pain and sorrow of Violetta.My dedication and passion for music helped me to succeed in entering the Hong Kong Academy for Performing and Arts at 9 and a chance to study with Mr. Gabriel Kwok, the renowned master of keyboard from the British Royal Academy of music. He was the first teacher that teased my clumsy performance mistakes instead of shouting at me and he was the first teacher that insisted we not move on until I met his standards. He was also the first teacher to introduce the concept of sound quality and how music consisted of not only dynamic “forte” and “piano”, but also the colors and contrasts which could be created through differences in the speed and touch of keys. Mr. Kwok’s ideas were amazing to grasp but torturous to master, once forcing me to only play two lines of Mozart Sonata in a whole class. But his wonderful exhibition and patience finally helped me to progress to a new level. He rarely forced me to imagine music in a fixed way, but always gave me space to think and create. For instance, when he made up the story of a hunter inside the forests in Mozart’s Sonatina, he only matched story with three phrases in the piece and asked me to finish it in my music. More importantly, he always emphasized the importance of loving music smartly because finding a balance of passion and rationality when performing on the stage is rare. His ideas about dedication and passion affected my development of piano as much as my top ranked performance in calculus or becoming a top tennis player in my school. Most of all, Mr. Kwok inspired me to give 3 hours every day playing and creating with passion on the piano. After 12 years of piano playing, I can see those black and white keys as part of a cipher box that opens gates to other worlds. Deciphering requires not only correct notes, but also apt feelings. So, I can still struggle to match the variation of Mendelssohn or show the balance between German rhythmic exactitude and Romantic fantasy’s passion, continuing to push on the doors not yet open for me. Yet, once these barriers are opened, I fly back to the Age of Faith through Bach’s Fugues, I am Mozart performing a sonata in an 18th century palace, and I witness the ghosts and gods from legends in Ravel’s haunting notes. There are endless doors in the world waiting for me to discover, with unimagined wonders and secrets behind them. I’ve learned about Beethoven and felt the humanity behind his music, I’ve dedicated 8 years of cello experience to enjoy the group dynamic of an orchestra, and I’ve stayed up all night to feel the natural passion for music during Flamenco parties in Italy. I know I still have many steps to take on my long journey in my exploration of music, and I look forward to each new step and opening each new door.",

It was only natural for me to play “Chopin Rondo”, my favorite piece. As I continued through the piece’s rich mountains and valleys of emotion, people stopped to listen. At the bursting finale, the entire hotel seemed to erupt into applause and the cook went to prepare a special pork knuckle dish for me .This amazing transformation of attitude and emotion through the power of music is why my future goals lie in music and why the dual-degree program at Northwestern university are a perfect fit.I’m already been involved in my own kind of dual degree, going from weekday classes in a top high school in Mainland China to hours of travel for weekend practice and performance in the finest music school in Hong Kong. Going from lectures on19th century Romanticism to derivatives to three hours of daily piano practice is not only a difficult road to travel but even more difficult to excel at. Yet, my journey has been the source of endless joy because I’ve learned to love pushing myself and learning, in the classroom or in Ettlingen’s castle in Germany. This is why I would feel as comfortable among the futuristic buildings on the North campus area of NW as I would in the more artistic South campus area, eating a real hot dog on the North Shore as I would performing and dancing at Dillo Day. I look forward to continuing a challenging and dynamic path in life at the world-class double degree program at Northwestern, which would be the ideal path to becoming a more accomplished musician and educated in a subject I love."

    "CommonApp": "Both of my parents grew up farmers, helping their parents with onerous work and struggling to get away from poverty. In China, if you have a rural household registration,it is much more difficult to do anything in a city: apply for insurance, get a job, or send your kid to school. As a result, young people in the countryside need to be many times more strenuous than peers in cities, where many of the professional opportunities exist, and also have to withstand condescending glimpses from urbanites even as they strive forward. My family is now living a good life in one of the most prosperous cities in China, and despite company and encouragement from family members, they are delighted to have left farming behind. However, when I was eight, they professed that they wanted me to experience that life. I was confused: why did my parents try so hard to escape the old life while still expecting me to sample it?As I beheld the muddy site, I was disappointed and lonely-there were no partners to play with and I did not know much about my grandparents. Nevertheless, crops I had never seen before incited my innocent, curious instinct. I was complacent when I saw what we had accomplished by the end of the day, and all things seemed not as terrible as I originally envisioned. There were, of course, burdensome works that request the strength of my entire body. But when I was working in the fields, part of my blood felt convivial, like a wandering son returning to the arms of his ancestors. What strengthened this unprecedented feeling was the story of my great-grandparents. My grandpa described in a tender voice, “My father was a farmer yet he fortuitously became a resourceful general in World War II. After the war, however, he decided to come back to the pastoral life hoping his family to live in a tranquil condition. Thus the essence of our family still remained.”I began to believe strongly in my blood relationships, seeing myself in the stories of my family’s past. That summer and the summers that followed unwittingly infused me with a sense of labor and unfolded an intriguing history. Recently, although I’ve gone to my grandparents’ less frequently, my skills as an agricultural outsider did not vanish. This past October, my high school offered two options for a service week: studying in schools located in rural provinces or doing agricultural education. I chose the latter, which was regarded as odd because normally, it is students who are not qualified for the first choice that are assigned to the farmland. Moreover, my classmates considered being farmers beneath them. But I could see easily what I would experience if I chose the former, while the latter was full of potential. When I got there, I realized that our work could not be accurately defined as farm work. Commonly, students were murmuring about the hard conditions and expressing their hatred toward the annoying mosquitoes and burning-hot sun, but I felt powerful when I was ditch-digging and turning up the soil, along with other industrious jobs regardless of my occasional asthma. One of my best friends asked, “Why are you so serious about this experience? I mean, it’s not like we have to try.” I hesitated and said, “Well, you know, I want to get the outstanding trainee at the end of the program.”I knew the answer was not strictly true, but I had no better choice. After I spit out the words, I recognized that through my family, I had inherited both the pride and humility from farm work. When I deal with convoluted problems or manual labor, my heritage frames my character to be more self-effacing and tougher. While I have often been reluctant to embrace it,”the relationship between my family’s past and me is always “to be continued.”",

With fewer restrictions and more challenges, people must solely utilize their voices to express ballads, church music, or contemporary melodies. Our school didn’t have a group, so my friend and I decided to establish “Supertonic.”We perform everywhere – school, around the city, and in all sorts of different environments. However, we felt that we needed something more permanent for group members to take with them and contacted a studio to begin our first recording experience.Being in the studio was the first time I felt my significance in the group so clearly. When we performed on stage, I always felt like I sang in obscurity. People usually don’t notice the alto part, since it is often superseded by higher pitches or powerful solos. The audience doesn’t know that, serving as the only alto, I have to be a strong singer, as well as develop other talents, including teaching myself music theory and how to arrange songs in order to keep the group on pitch. ;But, in the studio, I was the first track recorded: only my melody ran through the whole score, and was needed to calibrate others’ intonations, because my part built connections with others’ as a consistent root.I was proud to hold such a role. I am an unnoticed leader who gives other members rhythm and speed, like a solid foundation supporting the whole building.After few seconds, I cleared my throat and sang the first part of my score. Smiles, waves, and raised fists from the rest of the group let my overwhelming nervousness disappear. This magic had occurred before– whether in practices or in performances, our whole group’s determination to be the best singers we can be and the camaraderie we’ve built drive me to reach beyond expectations.A Capella has witnessed my growth as a person. No longer am I the person lost in trying to be a soprano with overwhelming power. Now I am confident about each role I play. Though I may not sing the most dazzling parts, I have at last found the niche for my talents, no matter how much energy it takes. With trustworthy friends giving me encouragement instead of going alone, I’ll continue sticking to all my dreams about music, academics and life."

    "CommonApp": "As a little girl, I was just barely old enough to remember hearing something a woman said. The words melted around the edges of my brain and haunted me. “Yes, girls are inferior to boys intellectually. The only way a woman can succeed is for her to marry well – not study well.”The woman, who later turned out to be my aunt, predicted that as a girl I would be in huge trouble dealing with disciplines related to science, such as Physics, Chemistry or Mathematics. It wouldn't be the last time for me to hear such outrageous comments. She lived next door.Being merely a young girl, I was susceptible to any spoken idea or opinion whether true or false. While her words could have easily taken me down a different path, I was fortunate to take them as a challenge. I secretly imagined a silent battle of “notions”, one that had been put forth by my aunt. Fueled with a strong desire to win, I worked diligently up through junior high earning straight A's and recognition for Most Outstanding Graduate. It seemed I was destined to win the battle.I artfully showed off my success to my mother ensuring that my aunt was present. I waited for triumph silently as my aunt picked up and examined my report card. My fists balled up as she began to murmur to my mom that she should not get comfortable. “She will fall behind the boys in senior high. Boys have an inherent advantage in learning and when they attach importance to schoolwork they will easily surpass girls in science.” Shocked by such pessimistic predictions, I stormed back to my room fighting back my anger, sorrow and indignation.Lying in bed, I realized that the only practical way to change her ideas would be to smash her stereotypical predictions. Mathematical formulae and functions became my most powerful weapons. Economic principles and concepts became my closest allies and brought me much joy. Physics and Chemistry were always on my “favorite disciplines” list, and they helped build up my confidence whenever I easily solved complicated problems using my own skills and knowledge.Gradually, my focus shifted from science to math – the battle I had started as a young girl slowly faded. Algebra, geometry, functions, equations, integrals, derivatives and many more concepts enthralled me and set my mind on majoring in Mathematics in college. My enthusiasm for science, especially the mathematical aspects allowed me to compete against my male peers and ultimately shatter “traditional” stereotypes regarding girl's education.Immersing myself in math and enjoying school life, I had no time to pay attention to what my aunt had said. However, to my surprise, she surrendered and demonstrated great respect for my accomplishments in senior high. She said to a neighbor, “My niece is smarter than any boy I know!” Victory was mine!As in most stories, a satisfying ending contains a protagonist overcoming obstacles through hard work and determination. I merely won a battle with a typical stereotype that had been embedded in my aunt's mind. China, regrettably, has numerous stereotypes just as my aunt had. In class meetings, parties, and even family reunions, little seemingly harmless comments infect others with the presupposition that girls are inferior to boys. To me, this situation seems desperate and even heart-breaking. I realize that no matter how hard I work to eliminate bias and discrimination, most of the time I will fail. But I realize the interconnectedness of the world in which we live, and I firmly believe if every girl put efforts into proving those notions false and fighting against discrimination, the world could be greatly influenced and eventually changed. While it seems unlikely that such a utopian idea could ever come to pass, we all must start somewhere. I am drawing a line in the sand and I will help others do the same.",
    "Supps": "题目：Johns Hopkins School Essay\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I have derived my interests in applied math and statistics from playing bridge. Playing against professional bridge players is not merely a test of your familiarity with bridge rules, but also a competition where participants show mastery of logic, statistics and mathematics. They are magicians, turning conceptual knowledge into useful weapons against the opponents.Focusing on a combination of abstract theories and practical use, I attach great value to Hopkins’ spirit of research and exploration. Hopkins is my magician! In an age of knowledge, information, and technology explosion, it is not enough to be merely a dull receiver of formulae and principles – actually, it is essential to employ what you have learned and create your own knowledge. “At Hopkins, we don’t just disseminate knowledge. We create it.” Most Hopkins students, enjoying the abundant research resources at Hopkins both inside and outside the classroom, take advantage of the theories and skills they learn in class to solve realistic problems. Yearning to be a superb researcher, I expect to enrich my experience, transcend myself and make original contributions actively to my area at Hopkins.Hopkins’s motto, “the truth shall make you free”, inspires me by revealing that the only way to rid ourselves of ignorance is to approach the truth faithfully and persistently. Seeking truth incessantly and learning voraciously are essential to success! Thus, I regard Johns Hopkins University as a perfect match and the best place for me to thrive. The well-planned courses provided by Hopkins covering multifarious areas such as linear algebra, differential equations, discrete mathematics and statistics will help me construct a complete system of knowledge. Other courses taken in my area of focus may enhance my understanding of a particular field and lead me to approach the core of it. While self-studying AP statistics and calculus, I relished the experience of exploring a new area by myself but would also highly appreciate a mentor who could guide me from confusion when needed. Renowned for its outstanding teaching quality and unparalleled professors, Hopkins is a wonderful place for me to achieve academic excellence.Moreover, Hopkins attracts students all over the world because of the precious opportunities to broaden their horizons. For example, the Hopkins Engineering Exchange Programs in multiple countries will offer me new insights into international engineering study and countless advantages in global competition with independent life skills and resourceful knowledge. Having developed an extraordinary enthusiasm for cultural exchange and fresh academic experience during Crimson Summer Exchange Program, I would like to explore social science and natural science and learn local culture in Hopkins University College London. I would also like to walk in the campus of National University of Singapore and discuss with the exceptional professors there.Overall, the profound research resources, the world-class course design and professors and endless opportunities for students to achieve all-around development at Hopkins will guarantee a promising college life for me. I sincerely hope to embark on a refreshing journey at Hopkins and become a part of its proud heritage."

    "CommonApp": "“Hey, Ivy! Let’s skip P.E. class together, it’s so boring.”“Well, all right,” I responded.Though I actually wanted to attend class instead of gossiping meaninglessly with my friends, my feeble intensions were quickly conquered by the fear of being left alone. Yes, I was afraid of loneliness. A good follower as I was, I tended to ignore my true desires and end up following the mainstream.The turning point appeared when I encountered the terrifying P.E. Test, an indispensable part of the senior high school entrance exam. I was really anxious as I did extremely poor on running. So when my friend Helen suggested practicing running after school, I immediately agreed.On the first day after evening self-study, I failed to find Helen. For a moment, I felt isolated and helpless. The sky was black, the birds were silent, and the runway was endless. Overwhelmed by the silence, I got frightened. I wanted desperately to go home. But then I imagined what might happen if I failed in my P.E. test. Almost instantly, the sorrow devoured my whole mind. I lingered for a while, and then I took a deep breath and began running. Soon after, I started panting. My body became fatigued and my heart was beating fast. Paying no attention to my body’s complaints, I kept running, albeit at a slow pace. Gradually, things started to change. I felt like everything inside me was vibrating with energy. All the components of my body, after sitting at desk for days on end, were enjoying the relaxing rush of movement. Without noticing, I reached the finish line. I was so surprised. When practiced running with my friends, I always struggled to keep up with them. Unsurprisingly, my energy was used up quickly and every step seemed a form of physical and psychological torture. Ever since that day, I began to enjoy practicing running alone. I felt unrestrained and free, as I could master my own pace and set my own goals. I practiced every evening in the moonlight’s shimmer, and worked consistently to break my own records. After almost every practice, my body was sore and my breathing was heavy, but I still felt cheerful about any improvements in my running time, no matter how slight. Days of practice brought me a strong and unprecedented feeling of self-achievement. And when someone did run with me, I was able to keep my own pace.After one month of training, I got a full mark on the physical education exam. I really appreciated that experience and all of the nights leading up to it. Also, I discovered that my fear towards loneliness had disappeared.  I learned to enjoy being alone, when I could have more time to enrich my inner world. From then on, I no longer wavered among different people’s viewpoints, but insisted on my own perspectives. I started enjoying what I truly wanted to do, like reading books about modern science and cooking, instead of accepting every party invitation. I was fascinated by the wonders of the World and I am determined to explain them scientifically. One day, I will figure out “theory of everything” and step into every inches of the Earth. Whenever I feel confused, I still run alone on the track. Running in the wind, I decided to continue my education in the US while most other peers chose UK; listening to my heart beats, I confirmed my future plan and determine to embrace infinite possibilities. No longer a follower anymore, I am now an optimistic, confident and strong-minded girl. I am able to take responsibility for every decision I make. Moreover, my confidence helps me stand out and contributes to my success of being a leader in our Student Union. To me, it is not only a change from a follower to a leader, but more importantly, from a child to an adult.",
    "Supps": "题目：Last August, Susan Grant, chief nurse executive for Emory Healthcare, said this of Emory’s choice to treat patients with Ebola: \"We can either let our actions be guided by misunderstandings, fear and self-interest, or we can lead by knowledge, science and compassion. We can fear, or we can care.\" Consider her idea of doing what is in the public interest despite potential cost. Please discuss an example in your life or the life of another that's come to your attention. (500 word limit)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I used to believe I was living in a peaceful era. I could not even imagine the cruel wars, where blood and bones were scattered everywhere, had actually occurred in the reality. In my world, life is filled with opportunities and hopes, and all the people are making effort to strive for their own well-being, wealth and social status. As soon as I grasp the opportunities and realize my goals, I can gain rewards and lead a life I dreamed for. However, my attitude was profoundly challenged when I encountered a special person, and an inspirational organization. ;Recently, I read an article saying that a Hong Kong lady, Jiexin Huang, quitted her rewarding job at Ming Pao Weekly, and joined in a non-profit organization called Doctors without borders. To be honest, I was confused. Why did she give up such a decent job and choose to work in places of danger and poverty? Astounded by her example, I was exposed to new land which I had never paid close attention to before. I had no idea that there is a corner on earth called Republic of Liberia, which is crammed with wars, diseases, and poverty. It is a region where infant death rate is as high as 15% and people have to dig over forty meters to get “drinkable” water.In such severe conditions, medical volunteers, like Jiexin, still persist in their responsibilities. They do not just provide basic medical treatment to that chaotic place but more importantly, they bring love and hope to those desperate and abandoned. “You cannot see Needs if you close your eyes.”  ;Jiexin said. Although those volunteers lost their time to enjoy family’s company and material satisfaction, they still love their jobs for the enrichment which can never be substituted by material possessions. We frequently hear the news that some regions are under a threat of torturous diseases and in urgent need of medical assistance, but we seldom take action. However, under huge pressure people like Jiexin give up their prestigious social status and devote to humanitarian assistance despite potential costs. ;Thanks to Doctors Without Borders, I realized the infinite possibilities of life. Not everyone’s dreams are the same as what I pictured before. What I believe commonsense is built upon the fact that I live in a safe environment with medication, education and family.  ;We live our lives only once, we have different pursuits and dreams, and we will gain mental happiness for realizing our own values. From then on, I no longer isolated myself in my own world, but began to help those unfortunate with my little savings. I want to develop a mature medical system and a complete education environment for them and let everyone live with dignity. Even though I am not capable of accomplishing my dreams now, I expect to be a part of this organization when I accumulate enough professional knowledge. Just like Jiexin, I will stay truthful to myself bringing joy and hope to people in need."

    "CommonApp": "I don’t remember much about her appearance. Maybe the only distinctive feature was her darker skin, indicating she was from remote southwestern China, where the sun is stronger. I thought our paths were just separate trajectories, randomly intersecting at one point for the five days when she attended my high school as an exchange student. However, she had an incredible impact, teaching me that being strong means facing yourself, your past and being open to others.For the whole week, we barely talked. She sat next to me in class, but the only words we exchanged were something about the class schedule and school cafeteria, and even these conversations ended quickly. In the dorm, she remained quiet and read a novel, without looking up. I barely noticed as she wrapped herself up in a small corner of her world. The final exam was coming, and I busied myself with homework.The truth is, I had my own small corner of the world where I was also hiding. As I threw myself into finals, I knew, deep in the dark attic of my mind, I was trying to forget that the anniversary of my father’s death was approaching. My father passed away when I was young. Growing up, I never told anyone about my family; in daily conversation, I even changed “my mom” into “my parents” to avoid suspicion. I felt that burying this secret was the best way to avoid being seen as too vulnerable and appearing inferior in some way.I had never considered opening up about my past, but this quiet stranger changed that. Upon returning to my room the day she left, I saw a letter on my table and read it. Dali (I had even forgotten her name) apologized, saying she was once much more outgoing, but her parents recently divorced, which is still somewhat taboo in China. “I grew more and more reticent and reserved, unconsciously, maybe partly as the way to protect myself from getting hurt again.” I trembled as I read. I could understand every word describing how she was affected because I too felt weakened by the tragedy in my life. But her next words struck me even more. “I signed up for this exchange program in hopes of making new friends in a different city to start afresh, but I didn’t know how to open up. I am so sorry.” She also thanked my roommate and me for our warmth and kindness.After I finished the letter, a mixture of guilt and regret swelled within me. Nothing I did could be construed as warmth! However, what shocked me most was her bravery to expose herself so honestly in this letter. And while Dali felt she had failed in her goal, I recognized the courage it took for her to try and move forward, to open up and make changes in her life. I avoided, I hid, I even lied about my past. I envied her strength.Dali taught me that facing pain and sorrow is not equivalent to surrendering to it, which helped me accept my past to heal and move forward. In time, I realized that I have the strength to be vulnerable, and that living openly and honestly leads to stronger relationships and a more fulfilling life. I still regret, so deeply, that I did not reach out to Dali. In being consumed in my own world, I lost the opportunity to learn more from hers. Being distant or detached means lost chances to partake in a splendid life; we could have supported each other through our journeys, and learned from one another. But thanks to Dali, I will now never forget that each passerby has a life as vivid and complex as my own.She will never know the effect she had on me, but because of Dali, today I am stronger and more open, to everything and everyone.",

We know nobody fits neatly into 500 words or less, but you can provide us with some suggestion of the type of person you are. Anything goes! Inspire us, impress us, or just make us laugh. Think of this optional opportunity as show and tell by proxy and with an attitude.

Just like the heated beverage with floating marshmallow that can save a bad day, I can always cheer myself up with optimism. I remember on my first day to attend Plato’s Symposium Seminar, a typhoon struck Shanghai with pouring rain. “You will get completely soaked if you insist traveling across the city just for a two-hour discussion session! Give up the crazy idea.” I thought to myself. However, I then recalled the previous night I spent diving in the obscure text of Greek philosophy. The annoyance of terrible weather only compared to be trivial when I looked on the bright side---the excitement to share my understanding in the notion of love presented in Symposium as well as discuss with college advisors majoring in Classics and Philosophy. At the bookstore where the seminar was held, I showed up with hair dripping with water, but also with a smile.I am cinnamon black tea with a pungent flavor. While black tea is universally popular, not everyone finds the taste of cinnamon enticing. It’s exactly the same case with the hobby of solving puzzles; not every jigsaw lover understands why I don’t mount my finished work to a board and treasure it forever. When a fellow jigsaw lover saw me taking apart a massive puzzle that took me months to complete, she nearly screamed. But I can’t help it; once I’ve completed a puzzle, I immediately take it apart, piece by piece. The reason is simple: when I stare at the completed picture, I only see the result of my efforts, an end-product; instead, if the puzzle pieces are back in a state of chaos, what comes to my mind is the fulfilling joy of molding the seemingly unrelated mass into a finite object. For me, the process is always more vital than the final accomplishment.I am peppermint herbal tea with refreshing aroma. While peppermint stimulates the nerve, thinking from another angle stimulates my creativity. “Fewer readers are coming to my blog where I posted all my recent reviews on contemporary Chinese poems. Maybe I simply can’t write anything good.” Staring at the message from my friend, the founder of the poetry club at my high school, I stopped to search for other possibilities that caused the problem other than putting blame on the quality of his writing. Maybe he didn’t target at the right readers? Soon I came up with this idea of extending the readership by helping post his reviews as an online magazine series so that they can be shared on a larger scale. My friend not only found more readers than ever who like and support his works, but also was motivated to continue analyzing the symbolism and context of selected poems to introduce his passion for poetry to more people. Whimsical ideas come up to me when I manage to change the perspective and think differently.3 teaspoons of optimism, quirkiness and ingenuity plus one crucial drop of William & Mary undergraduate education. Time to enjoy!"

    "CommonApp": "The last dish of the Chinese New Year meal was being served – a traditional fish dish that immediately filled the room with a sweet-and-sour odor and white steam. Not long after it lands on the table, chopsticks were clipping together and spoons were diving down into the fish, almost finishing the delicacy in minutes. Before the last bites were taken my grandpa interrupted, “It’s time to stop eating! We must leave some leftover!” My cousin who moved to America at the age of seven asked in an astonished voice: “Why shouldn’t we finish the fish? It’s so delicious!” Hearing his question my family all laughed – we realized that he had been living abroad for too long. Smiling, I explained to him, “Don’t you remember that the pronunciation for “fish” and “surplus” is the same in Chinese? We leave the fish unfinished because we want a surplus of precious things in life too!”My family always united in Nanjing for Chinese New Year, but that year was especially important since it was my grandma’s 90th birthday. Thus, three of my cousins who were living overseas came back to Nanjing, but understandably they appeared to be somewhat removed from Chinese culture.My cousin’s question about the dish prompted me to think about all the important traditions my family still holds on to. During the Lantern Festival, when many people just go to the supermarket to buy some frozen dumplings, our family would always watch dragon dancing in Lian-Hua Mountain. While many people have forgotten the real meaning and family connotations connected to the Double Ninth Festival, our family would always climb a nearby mountain and pay respect to our older relatives. Sadly, nowadays many Chinese people seem to have forgotten important traditions while money is now coveted over anything else. Indeed, China has changed enormously after it “opened up” to the world, and this great transition raises many questions in my mind. “Have Chinese people gradually overlooked many traditions because of western influences? Is the West responsible for bringing a bourgeois and materialistic culture? Should we blame the West for the changes taking place in China?” Harboring these questions, I asked my cousins their opinions on the West and also why China appears to be forgetting traditions. Contrary to my preconceived idea that the West had somehow “ruined” China, they commented that from their observations Western society still values traditions in many ways. Families always unite on Thanksgiving and Christmas, parents often serve as “soccer moms” or “baseball dads”, and people often value family over money.Hearing their thoughts, my worldview suddenly appeared much too narrow. Sadly, in sharp contrast to what my cousin described, many Chinese sent their children to be raised by the Grandparents and many couples seldom live together, all because of the excessive desire to pursue money, power, and fame. I once read an Australian’s article on Chinese: You guys are very hard-working and make a lot of money, but I think you don’t know how to enjoy life and care for the family. After that union in Nanjing, I had deeper understanding of responsibility and traditions, and I realized the importance of pursuing the real treasures in life rather than the superficial ones. In the future, no matter what part of the world I am, opening to new experiences will be part of my life, but I would never forget that my roots are planted in China, that old, timeworn house in Nanjing. Sitting around that dining table where we spend our spring festival every year, leaving that little bit of leftover fish and embracing the traditions that I grew up knowing and loving – ones that I will continue for generations to come.",

This torch not only serves as a symbolic beacon calling me to New York, but also as a source of inspiration to further ignite my passion for dynamic experiences both in and out of the classroom. The ‘light’ that NYU offers will serve to illuminate my life, career and future.Illuminating a path for a brighter future. While pursuing a major in environmental science at NYU, I dream someday of bringing China out of the ‘darkness’ that it currently faces with its detrimental smog problem. Remarkably, NYU offers courses that will give me the knowledge to take on such real-world problems. Within the Environmental Studies Capstone Seminar, students excitingly use all the theoretical knowledge learned in class to tackle practical problems. Previous topics included solar power projects, green roof design and green household development. These current, practical projects will serve to inspire and allow me to create new projects for a brighter future in my homeland.Igniting passion for taking action. As an international student, NYU’s International Environmental Law Clinic is something that truly excites me. Within these clinics students have been able to draft laws and regulations as well as undertake research for organizations like the UN, international NGOs and governments of developing countries. Real-world opportunities like this not only serve as vital examples to learn from, but also as forms of action that will directly tackle current issues that I am passionate about. ;Enlightening me in ways that only New York City can. Relaxing in Washington Square Park, catching the latest opening at the MoMA, trying the variety of delicacies hailing from around the world or joining NYU’s tennis club – my daily life will be filled with a myriad of experiences. The sights, flavors and people of NYC will allow me to become more than just a citizen of China. Within this international setting that fosters dynamic students, I will train to be a glowing citizen of the world.  ; While the NYU logo simply consists of a torch and three letters, the simplistic design carries connotations that create feelings of passion and burning inside. This fall 2016, I am ready to let this passion fully ignite and start on a path of enlightenment that only NYU can offer, and I will learn to light and carry my own torch into the future."

    "CommonApp": "‘My boyfriend quarreled with me yesterday, but I don’t think he wants to apologize for his rudeness.’‘Physics is too difficult. I don’t want to learn it any longer!’‘I studied till midnight yesterday, but my mother still said I’m not hard-working enough.’……    As a mediator, I get a variety of such information every day, and what I do is to give them suggestions, rekindle their hopes, and let them continue to do what they should do. Though giving different ideas every day, I have already been familiar with this situation. The reason why I insist is that I not only feel proud when I manage to help others, but also gain progress for myself. From the story of Jasper and his girlfriend, I learnt that explanation is much better than a fight. Dealing the problem of Ashley’s relationship with his mum, I got alone with my parents much more harmonious….. As the old saying goes, Lookers-on see more than the players. I’m very grateful for the special position of mediator, which enables me to consider the complete matter as a whole and improve my life without meeting the setbacks my friends have gone through.However, there are many people who cannot understand my deed. Jim once considered my behaviors as ‘a waste of time’, which made me wonder for quite a long time. ‘Except getting pride and avoiding the same problems, what else can l benefit from the ability of communication?’ I asked myself. ‘I don’t know.’ A voice rose from my heart.A year passed, and I became a high school student. I joined 3H club (two hands together with one heart), which held an activity with students from a primary school in Kenya. We took lectures about their lives and made Skype with them, from which I learnt that their education is incomplete and living condition is poor. Later on, from the letters I wrote to my Kenya friend, Hank, I realized more about their lives, so I helped him as much as I could in academic tasks, told him the interesting life in China, and encouraged him to develop his potential and be optimistic about everything around. This January, Hank said he felt very energetic and full of hope no matter what he did and thanked me for my inspiration, and I suddenly realized that it was my communication with him that helped him so much and even changed his attitude towards his life. To my great surprise, when I meet some challenges, Hank’s words and the scene of his life always appear in my mind and tell me to persist instead of losing hope. ‘Is this the benefit of communication?’ ‘Perhaps.’ The voice said, indecisively.Based on this experience, I was more interested in developing my communication ability. As the commissary in charge of sports in class, I arranged the enrollment and practice of the sports meeting. Although there were many contradictions during the process, I communicated with every member that participated in the match and told them to cooperate, and I settled the conflict successfully and our class got many awards in the sports meeting; Learning that Chinese’s environmental pollution is quite severe, I joined a project about perfluorinated compounds at college this semester. I carried out research about the best extractant, and based on our communication, we managed to discover the basic characteristic of the compounds and the harm they did to people. ‘Is this the benefit of communication?’ ‘Exactly.’ This time the voice no longer hesitated.Now I realize that my ability of communication may not be limited to mediate life trifles but may bring me optimistic and the spirit of cooperation as well. But to the most part, my passion for communication may even contribute to the team and the social life, and I will certainly spare no effort for it in the future.",

I believe the Major of Chemistry in USC will enable me to better connect chemistry, the environment and humans together.Independent research has been among my most valuable experiences. Last year, I experimented to find the most effective flocculants water-cleaning agents by comparing important factors such as particle size and temperature. This year, I did another project about perfluorinated compounds in indoor areas and constructed models to understand the harm they cause to people of different ages. These two projects let me realize the seriousness of the crisis around us at present, but more importantly, I come to know that my dream to improve the world is not untouchable. Thus, I attach great importance to research, and am excited about the cutting-edge research opportunities in USC, specifically, the Center for Advanced Sustainable Energy(CASE). Aiming to develop new technologies to collect and store energy sustainably, I am enthusiastic to help with such innovate work, and all the while, develop my own skills in research as well.Undoubtedly, knowing more about the damaging pollutants that are affecting our health, I won’t be satisfied until I make a meaningful contribution. With my perseverance and diligence, I am confident that I can reach my dream."

    "CommonApp": "My grandma once performed an exorcism on me. She caught me weeping while reading Uncle Tom's Cabin, so torn over Eva's death that I lost my appetite to eat. In her eyes, it is ominous for a child to weep before a meal, so she thought that I must have been possessed by some evil spirit needing to be removed. Of course, I stopped weeping soon after she rubbed her warm hands over my forehead, amusing me tremendously, but which did not dull my love for reading.Another time, I was reading a biography of Nalanxingde, a Qing Dynasty poet from a declined noble family. Fate assigned him a tragic life, instilling his poetry with heavy sentiment. I became so fascinated by his story that I was still reading at 1 a.m. When my mom discovered the light in my bedroom, she was so vexed that she grabbed my book and chucked it in the corner without a word. Despite my chagrin, I yielded to her totalitarian authority, and spent the rest of the night worried for the poet's uncertain fate.My mom and grandma eventually concluded that my excessive obsession with reading is genetic, a fact not entirely baseless. I was raised by my grandpa, who taught me the beauty of language. During the Cultural Revolution, the school he taught became a \"cattle shed\" to \"convert\" him and his fellow intellectuals. His books were burned, property confiscated, and he did the most laborious work for pursuit of learning. However, decades later, he is still a voracious reader of everything from news articles to research papers, from ancient volumes to newly published novels. For my third birthday, this same man bought me albums of Chinese characters, and gave me fairytale books as soon as I could read. Because of his open-mindedness, I was able to appreciate the deep ocean arena with Captain Nemo in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and experience the compunction of Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment. I will always remember the amazement in his eyes when I read Unsolved Mysteries of the World, inverted.Unbeknownst to my classmates at school, the small town seemed to shrink with each new book I encountered. Colors seemed to fade when the only channel available played the same show over and over again, before the benefits of modern access to information extended to this rural town. The flowing river, our bungalow not far from it, and the dogs and chicken reared in front of our bungalow, they accompanied me and nurtured me, but they no longer satiate my desire for knowledge.I remember when Charles Strickland (from The Moon and Sixpence) finally abandoned everything to move to Paris for the sake of painting. There was something about him that I admired, that I wanted to learn from, as if my pursuit of knowledge can transcend anything, much like his burning love for art.When my grandma attempted to remove the ominous spirit in me, my grandpa looked up from the book he was reading, and smiled. It was a warm smile, with a glimmer of compassion in his eyes, as if he just came back from paradise and found me in this shabby reality. He understood. In some ways, I think it was a part of his plan from the beginning, to show me the world through novels so that I'd be emboldened to someday see the world for myself, accomplishing what he failed to do in his lifetime.Over the years, I have lived vicariously as the adventurous Passepartout on his serendipitous journey, the resourceful Huckleberry Finn in brave pursuit of freedom and justice, and, at times, as Sabina who has tasted the delicious lightness of life. Then, I am reminded that I'm the writer and protagonist of my own novel, and that there is a brand-new chapter in front of me, waiting to be composed.",

I wake up to jog with several friends on campus. Our morning talk fills the air with a mix of distinct accents, filling me with energy to make today a great day. It gives me the feeling that I don’t have to travel the world to see it; I can simply knock on the door of my neighbors to glimpse into their lives and culture. Yet most importantly, despite our differences, we share a deep sense of belonging; we treat each other like family. ;Following a quick breakfast, I rush to my favorite class by Professor Rajeev Patke, a renowned scholar. After class, as my classmates and I walk to the dining hall heatedly debating Professor Patke’s lecture, we encounter him again and he gives us an improvised speech right there, leaving us in awe once more. Drifting back to the question, I think I have an answer. Beyond just the degree, I believe a strong college community is what will shape me into a greater person. College is where I will meet supportive lifelong friends, create memorable experiences, and refine my work ethics and values. For that, I want to join the YaleINUS community, to work closely with professors that will go beyond expectations to teach us, and to share my life with brilliant students who possesses a similar passion for learning, while we nurture each other’s personal growth. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Why try something new?

I’m an alchemist, born with a mission to gather all the ingredients for the Magical Stone—an elixir that will transform my humanly life to historical immortality, a catalyst that will turn my short existence into an eternal legacy. But I’ve never been told exactly what these ingredients are, so I have to spend my life discovering the solution to this  ;alchemy. Ever since I was conscious of my mission, I’ve been puzzling over the secret. Is it  ;mercury? Is it sulfur? Or is it basalt? ;When a new material grabs my attention, I will store it in my satchel. Is it the ingredients? I don’t know. Luckily though, I’m not entirely clueless. I can tell immediately just by casting the new material into my smelter, and observing how it melds with the base element—my talent. Without ever losing faith in my mission, I have been collecting ingredients for 17 years.  ;I once saw a master playing the flute in a music hall. I was so impressed by the melody that I implored the master to mentor me. Naturally, I wished to incorporate the beautiful melody of this apparatus into my magical stone. Under the mentorship of the master, I practiced everyday, persevering despite already missing the best era for learning the flute; I was already fifteen, and my lung’s capacity was almost fixed. For two years I spent my leisure time playing the flute, enjoying the mellifluous music that I produced. ;Then somehow, I found that advancing my skills became difficult. It wasn’t like solving math problems or running track; it wasn’t even like playing my other instrument, Zheng. I found it hard to excel in playing flute, so that no matter how hard I tried, I still couldn’t control my breath as perfectly as my peers, nor catch the nuance of trill. That moment, I understood that the flute will forever be a peripheral component of my magical stone, not a key ingredient. ;Was I frustrated by this reality? Not in the slightest. I might not get to play flute in Carnegie Hall in my lifetime, but I can choose from numerous other orchestras to perform with in college and beyond. This twoIyear experiment was an inspiring ingredient that galvanized my love for music and deepened my understanding of myself. At every chance, I will continue to seize new ingredients without hesitation, whether it is a new instrument or a bold interdisciplinary research opportunity. My instinct tells me that I should never stop in my exploration, excavation, and discovery. Only by doing so will I be worthy of my role as an alchemist. ;"

    "CommonApp": "The spring of 1998 AD marks the grand navigation of Admiral Ashley to this New World. The Ashlian settlement befallen on the far east of the Asian continent. As a witness for 17 years, I am going to unfold you a picture of this wonderful country.Ashley is a joyous republic composed of three main states.Imagination state, the oldest state in the country, is the origin of Ashlian culture. In the center of the state is the Imagination Volcano. Every time it erupts, flowery literature and art pieces cover every corner. The seeds of Western literature and art were sowed on the arable land of the state, irrigated from the Lake of Greek mythology. The strong female role of Athena was favored over ancient Chinese lore praising females for being fragile, soft, and reserved. This state also underwent a period of Renascence in the arts—paintings of Forest Elves and ancient Chinese gentries cover the city walls. Ashlians especially enjoyed transcribing Japanese light poetry and Chinese proverbs, which have shaped the writing styles of modern Ashlians. Middle School Ages passed with an emergence of scientific knowledge; that was when the state of Curiosity burgeoned. Curiosity and eagerness prompted early scientists to sink the country in knowledge. Prompted by the favor of science, the country welcomed the AP Act, which encouraged Ashlians to pursue abstruse foreign physics and mathematic tools. These activities introduced the nation to algorithms and computer science.The seed of enlightenment then germinated, triggered by a foreign book, The Age of Reason. Ashlians were deeply amazed by the power of pure reason, as Paine calls, “the gift by God”. From then on, Ashlians shifted their interest to argumentative essays.Introduction of The Prince promoted a moral revolution in the country. Machiavelli argues that virtues, generosity and bountiful kindness should be replaced by shrewdness. Although Ashlians did not fully agree with the shocking views presented in the book, they realized the limit of morals, which leads to the need of laws to reinforce rules in a society. They turned to articles and TV shows about judicial logic and legal principles to strengthen their acceptance of laws into the land.The final, Criticism State encouraged its citizens to debate with each other whenever an issue arose. Foreign ideas and outside help were imported from sites like Quora. Contradictory point of views increased domestic production of criticism so that consumers gained better ability to discern the quality of imported ideas. One thing this nation will always be proud of is that her citizens will always have independent opinions.The influence of these historical periods all remains encoded in the genes of Ashlians. Curiosity of knowledge, fondness of art, admiration for reason and science, and the ability to think for themselves are integral characteristics of this country. Ashlians appreciate the simple beauties in life—daydreaming is not a sin; singing out loud in public is mandatory; they are easily filled with awe. Ashlians love science and knowledge—they do not believe in the existence of “useless” knowledge; they appreciate the color change in test tubes as much as myths about the Burmuda Triangle.Also, Ashlians think about the world—this is a thoughtful nation that advocates awareness about current news such as war refugees and fluctuation in markets; this nation considers it necessary to ponder its own history of formation and to look forward into its future path of development.   As aspiring as Ashlians are, they found that the current Ashlian settlement is not enough to satisfy their adventurous spirit and hunger for knowledge. Now, a team of adventurers is preparing to settle on another continent for some years, to further explore the world in honor of their country. Hope you, my dear reader, can permit our adventurers to settle and flourish on your rich territory, where more ideas await.",

Then Siri came along, which helped me make up my mind to study computer science, to explore the subject of artificial intelligence. ;I am delighted to find that eagerness for studying is welcomed and supported by NYU Tan-don School of Engineering. Through the accelerated BS/MS program, taking graduate level courses before I even receive a bachelor degree means that I could start learning artificial intelligence early. With the help from the Polytechnic Tutoring Center (PTC), one of the most comprehensive tutoring services that even include help from faculty members, I believe I can complete the basic foundation courses in computer science ahead of schedule. After I acquired a solid knowledge basis in these courses, I would like to take graduate courses such as Artificial Intelligence (CS-GY 6613), in which I can learn how to make a program think like a human, and create something like Siri. ;Furthermore, NYU also can help me to start career preparation early by providing opportunities in research and design for undergraduate students. Through design project courses, I can find and work with a mentor also interested in AI design who may teach me more practical experiences in AI projects not written in textbooks, such as the most efficient procedures to start a research and the mindset of computer scientists. ;Research groups like CILVR would allow me to study machine learning, a basic but important component in AI design. CILVR seminars will allow me to learn knowledge that can be applied to real optimization and engineering design problems in transportation, image classification, and more. Supported by the Dean’s undergraduate research fund, I can do research on campus with a group of undergraduate students during summer vacation.Whether it is the curriculum or the extracurricular resources, at NYU, I will have plenty of opportunities to do real projects and research so that I can apply the knowledge learned in class in practical use, and prepare for professional engagement in AI upon graduation."

    "CommonApp": "Ah, spotlight! --- The one and only thing that allows a powerful desire to express myself. My classmates and teachers do not naturally associate me with a huge fan of public speaking, since I am usually regarded as a typical science geek. Science geeks, stereotypically, are supposed to be reserved, timid and introverted. However, to be honest, it is the most relaxing moment for me to express myself freely under the spotlight, under the gaze of others.I started to speak in public when I was in junior high school. I was so deeply fascinated with a traditional art drama, called Hua Ji Xi, which originated from my hometown, Shanghai. Hua Ji Xi applied different dialects and represented a form of art that was on the edge of extinction. Collecting the dialects from different regions; imitating the accent as well as overcoming the nervous and restless feelings while I perform, became the three major difficulties on my way to perform Hua Ji Xi in front of more than a thousand audiences at school. Laughter, applause, smiling faces --- I almost felt dizzy under the spotlight watching the reactions of the audiences. I had never expected that words and performance could be so powerful. In the following months, I gathered some of my classmates and performed Broadway Shows Out of Order, music drama The Lion King and drama from Carlo Goldoni Servant of Two Masters. I could not resist but fell in love with the stage and spotlight.I went to looking for my spotlight after attending high school. This time, I was standing in front of the rostrum and addressing speeches for emotional resonance instead of merely laughter and applause. By chance, I met the president of an elite charity club in China called Rotary International, which rooted in the United States. I was deeply impressed by the mission of this club and decided to establish our own Interact Club, which was part of the Rotary for teenagers at my high school. With endless publicity campaigns and speeches, more than five hundred fellow schoolmates joined me and my Interact Club. Here, I have successfully established the largest school-based Interact Club in China. Now I am standing in front of the rostrum, firmly introducing what we have done in the Interact Club and where we are heading in the future. From then on, public speaking was no longer simply a way to fulfill myself as a performer to receive acknowledgement and appreciation from my audiences, but more of a powerful way to express myself, to make good differences in my community, even tiny ones. Spotlight, a beam to guide me towards my passion and beliefs; a power for me to lead and go further beyond.",

    "CommonApp": "Sipping my black tea with its sprinkle of chili, I ran through my mental checklist of the next 24 hours. First, I'd report to the play's director in the morning, make pastries at a bakery in the afternoon, and then prepare dinner according to my new recipe (which I call a 3D dinner) for my family. After dinner, I'd rush off to another city on a late night train, then finally use a new song I recorded to greet the rising sun the next day. This would be just another typical day in the life of me. Every day must be fresh, so I always combine seemingly contradictory elements: scrambled eggs+ Coke=something my parents refused to eat, DIY sneakers+ different paints=my signature shoes 1.0, a shower cubicle+ soundproof equipment=my recording studio, birthday gifts+ clues in Morse code=a weeklong mission for my classmate. Wait! Speaking about equations, what is the recipe of myself? People say I fail somewhere between passion and madness, but while this characteristic may be the appetizer, every recipe should be based around the entrée. For the meat, I'd have to choose the self-reliance I gained through struggling with the solitude of the tennis court. How? By lining up Coke cans and trying to hit ten out of ten. I later found that I'd not only have to train but also fight alone. During a match I'll always remember, my opponent's supporters made the most of their home court advantages by flooding the arena with boos for every mistake I made. Knowing the tennis court is a place where we never have a teammate to cheer for us after a good save or comfort us after a missed shot, I fought back. Despite still losing the game, I earned applause from my opponent and the audience. Therefore, this entrée is made from endurance, sprinkled with a positive determination to fight alone, and roasted under the pressure of a 36.60m by 18.30m tennis court. For flavoring, I like to choose subtle condiments that aren't too overpowering or tasteless. Through another important activity in my life, acting, I've become sensitive to the subtle differences of even the most intense emotions. Wiping away silent tears, quarreling tensely, falling to my knees while laughing like a lunatic before going off on a hysterical rant... Wait, is that really me? At that moment, I couldn't really tell, because I was caught up playing Truman in our performance of the Truman Show—the most emotionally complicated character I've ever played. The sourness, bitterness, spiciness and sweetness of the lives I experience on stage gives my own life a distinct flavor. Acting is like a dish layered with flavors: bitterness first hits my lips before combining, expanding, and deepening into many diverse aromas. Through performing on stage, I've also learned to share the spotlight. The first play I was in, I complained about my tiny part, which only had two lines of script. But just like Japanese Sukiyaki, in which a dozen different sauces are combined, only through a good dynamic with the supporting actors can the entire cast display the correct emotions. What's more, I'm no longer nervous of big audiences. Possibly because I go crazy on stage every time, but more likely because I know I'm not fighting alone. So does that mean my life=self-reliance from tennis+ sensitivity to subtleties and cooperation on stage? No. My life always has an X. If the recipe of my life were a cup of tea, then this X is the chili that makes it different. Everyone wants to change the world. Microsoft updates their systems every other year, Apple updates their cell phones every year, and what about me? I unveil a new \"me\" everyday, thus changing the world with an updated version of myself. I'm running out of spicy black tea, but don't worry. Maybe tomorrow I'll create a new menu with a refreshed X.",

Without hesitation, we rushed to the station, desperately hoping to catch the last shuttle to the top. “Six tickets please.” “Sorry, only three left.” “What?” These words lit up the blunderbuss. “Maybe three of us should go.” “You selfish thing! Where is our companionship?” “Fine, what about renting a car?” “Forget it! Already run out of money.” “Oh, come on! We just missed it like this.” ;The last shuttle left during the argument and people went back, downhearted, until late that night I shouted like a lunatic, “Folks, let’s go now!” Putting the sleepy guys onto the six bicycles I rented, I made our journey continue. All the speed and climbing races along with flirts and jokes in heavy rain demonstrated that the craziness paid off. Sitting side by side, we all witnessed the most splendid sunrise in our lives, the one belonging to brotherhood. Indeed, I belong to a crazy group of six, and the companionship we’ve formed during our various trips is the best adhesive. Each of us has a different role in the group. Personally, I tend to be the atmosphere coordinator, the crazy solution creator, and the one who won’t let anything impede my craziness and adventures.Sometimes the things I treat as common were regarded as ‘unreasonably’ crazy by others, as it is when I transformed Lays tins into studios, put a message bottle into East China Sea to see if it could flow back to me 20 years later, or tried to draw my dreams down and publish the pictures. On the other hand, sometimes I can find the ‘unreasonably’ craziness out of the common things taken for granted by others.Randomly picking up a common bottle for water, I found that the water bottle is conveniently designed for right-handed people. Then I rushed to my room just to find out the mouse was also designed for right-handed people and felt awkward in my left hand’s grasp. What’s more, that indifferent cursor on my computer always pointed to the upper-left corner for right-handed people’s convenience, reminding me that the left-handed were doomed for inconvenience. From then I realized that however devotedly our world take care of minorities, there is always minorities of the minorities, the ignored who wage a silent struggle. If I wanted to help the left-handed minority, I had to raise awareness first. Co-organizing Left-handers’ Day in the community, I advocated rights for lefties, and more minorities. Our community witnessed a crazy tide of parties for lefties, which all came from a common water bottle in my hand.When others think I get lost, only I myself know that I am more stuck to myself. Just as a magnet needs both a positive pole and a negative pole to be complete, the world needs both common and the crazy poles to be complete. I feel fortunate to stand for the crazy pole of the world."

    "CommonApp": "I’ve always loved science. I loved geology because it tells the history of the earth, biology because it explores the secrets of living creatures, chemistry because it contains the mysteries of chemical properties, and physics because it illustrates the forces of life. And yet, I could never understand why we were forced to study mathematics.Why should I recite and answer these insipid questions? It seemed like all these formulas were the same, especially when they could be solved with a calculator within a second! All I wanted to do was throw my mathematics homework aside, and go to the pond in my compound. There my friends and I would play “ducks and drakes,” vying to skip a flat stone the greatest number of times along the water’s surface. The pavilion in the center of the pond was my kingdom, because I had been the best shooter, but things changed when Iris moved to town. I lost my crown.As a teenager, I found it difficult to face such competition. It seemed impossible to surpass Iris’ record of twelve skips, but I was determined. Searching online, I was amazed to find that an association for ducks and drakes even existed. Furthermore, I found out that the world record was eighty-eight skips. Aha! So Iris’ record was nothing; I could break it. However, all my previous victories had been merely due to intuition; I’d need to turn to science this time. I’d need an equation.From my physics class, I knew I’d have to consider the texture and shape of the stones, the speed and angle at which I threw them, and many other factors. Through the long process of consulting books on theories of kinetic energy and damped vibration, I drew a step closer. After combining different formulas and considering various factors, I narrowed them down to three equations! I just needed to simplify these three into my own formula; success was right in front of me.Unfortunately, I couldn’t handle the trigonometric functions in order to complete the equation. The calculator kept giving me an irrational number like 0.2763846… How did these numbers help me simplify my equation? Suddenly, those “useless” mathematic techniques from class became important, so I sought help from Mr. Wang, my mathematics teacher. Knowing I didn’t like math, he’d help only if I promised to first review all we’d learned about trigonometric functions. I had no choice, if I wanted to figure out the knack of skipping stones.With some help from him, I finally got my equation: njumps=(V0^2x)/2αgl! It means I need to throw the stone as fast as possible and keep it parallel to the water. I found the trick! The stone jumped like there was a spring on it—a spring installed by my equation. One, two, three… Oh, how my heartbeat seemed to thump with each bounce. By the time I reached fourteen jumps, I couldn’t believe that I’d hated this amazing subject! And although I still can’t break the world record, I’m once again the “stone queen” in my neighborhood. I get my crown back!I now see the magic of mathematics everywhere. When introduced to a new friend at a party and he turns out to be an old acquaintance, I’m inspired to read about Ramsay Theory; when I play cards, game theory helps increase my chances of winning; when my mother wants to buy a new house, I can help her evaluate the differences between repayment and interest-only mortgages.John von Neumann said, “If people don’t believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they don’t realize how complicated life is.” But I prefer to say, “If people think life is too complicated, it is only because they don’t know mathematics.” I now love mathematics as more than just a tool; I love mathematics because it’s an art.",

No one shares as close a relationship with the floor as us. Each morning starts off when I arrive at school at six-thirty with the mist, the chirps, and the sound of my black knee protectors hitting the floor. Having played since eighth grade, the No. 8 subway line has witnessed my forearm go through changes, from white and delicate to bronzed and muscular. However, volleyball has had a profounder effect than just teaching me persistence. The volleyball court is the perfect stage to reinforce the bedrock of cooperation: trust.Without trust, we’ll fear conflicts, and at crucial junctures, such as when we’re discussing tactics, we’ll only have a superficial consensus among the team. I love catching my teammates eye in a competition; I love anticipating the first serve of the game; I love when my teammates commend me as a setter; I love the powerful spike of the main attacker; and I love our team’s cheer after making a point. However, all of these fantastic moments can’t happen without cooperation. There is Lew Androski who scored 5 points in nine minutes, and T-mac who made 13 points in thirty-five seconds. But there will never be a volleyball player who scores so many points and wins the game on their own.Volleyball is not just a sport I enjoy but also an unshakable part of my life."

    "CommonApp": "Pop! I stab the straw through the plastic film. My favorite bubble tea is a little odd—a mixture of green tea, jasmine flowers and red beans. Unlike the common combination of milk tea with tapioca pearls, the consummate representative of bubble tea, this \"greenish-yellow liquid blended with crimson beans\" is simply bizarre. \"Why do you like it, anyway?\" my friend asked.I smiled, thinking, it is so much more than just tea. As I begin sipping, my first taste is of roasted green tea and brewed jasmine flowers, bitter. Chewing the beans that have traveled up the straw and into my mouth, I am delighted by the burst of penetrating sweetness when one is split open. I hold one particularly sweet red bean in my heart: singing. Born without a \"voice of gold,\" my enthusiasm for music is inexplicable—I sang off-tune as a child, but stubbornly insisted that the vocal genes I inherited from my Henan-opera-singing grandmother would one day surface. Although my parents constantly recounted my first singing performance in which the pitches coming out of my mouth were completely out of place, I ignored their description and savored my enthusiasm. Yes, it seemed I lacked natural talent. But whenever I was free I would still click a song, put on my headphones, and practiced singing to my computer. As I recorded my music, listening to the playback, I closed my eyes and imagined myself standing on a stage. For many years, my dream had remained distant. The headphones stayed over my ears, until I bumped into an announcement seeking performers for a free neighborhood show. I registered with ecstasy and a little self-doubt. Finally standing on stage, the music seemed more real than ever. Looking at the supportive young and old, I was convinced: even as amateur as I was, the bittersweet process, like the taste of my bubble tea, nurtured a different happiness, an \"unconditional love\" for music in the simplest, most proactive way—just singing out. By the time my tea is half consumed, with a swift stir, the bitter-sweet distinction is blurred as the tea and beans interweave. The coalition of tea and beans finally leads to a new enlightenment, urging me to connect the \"cultural dots\" that enthralled me on a new stage. Every Chinese New Year, \"Xiang Sheng\" Chinese cross-talks and comedy dramas are broadcasted nationally, showcasing this traditional form of Chinese comedy art. Although the shows are constantly forgotten when the New Year fervor dissipates, my interest in this tradition, rooted in the rich variety and historical depth into the intonations, dialects, and cultural knowledge in the performances, remains. As a dweller of a new metropolis, somewhat disconnected from my hometown, I often seek paths leading back to my cultural heritage. I began to wonder: Why not perform myself? This question encouraged me to take the stage again. During one show in school, I performed passionately, switching from a Liaoning dialect to a Hunan accent. I saw that students of diverse origins in different provinces in China, responded with laughs and knowing smiles as they heard familiar tones. I realized that I cherished this art just like I cherished my bubble tea. Whereas both are wide confluences of different elements, by performing and hence forging the community together, I paid my fondness for the tea forward. Why do I persistently favor green tea mixed with jasmine flowers and red beans? Ultimately, I believe that my enthusiasm is for the splendor inside the drink's unusual taste and appearance: the bitter-sweetness of my music, the mixed dialects in the cross talk shows, and most significantly, the stories that compose who I am. Whenever I carry this beverage, I am in fact carrying an indispensable part of my personality - my unwavering belief in unlimited possibilities. I will keep stirring, swirling and sipping—hoping to see what stories can be added to my life, to my bubble tea.",

    "CommonApp": "Since I have been living in a city with more than 20M population since birth, I have long wondered how the city functions orderly. Therefore, it wasn’t surprising that I chose to do a project about urban planning when I entered high school. At that time, the concept of “urban planning” to me was similar to “data analysis”, so I believed that by the simple idea of collecting data and then processing it, I could reach the conclusion I needed. Actually, that is exactly the way I worked on the project in the first place. I decided to research on the living, especially walking patterns of senior citizens in one specific neighborhood. Everything I needed to fully understand it is the velocity, location of my subjects and their evaluation of the neighborhood, and all of them can be acquired with some short field work. Therefore, I set out to the neighborhood to conduct my work, and that is when my entire comprehension about urban planning, or even scientific research, started to change.It was a hot summer day with few pedestrians on the road, but I was well-prepared for such situations. In fact, I’ve imagined all kinds of unexpected cases, such as no one was willing to take the GPS device with them, or some of them answered my survey question but paid no attention, but what surprised was that actually I didn’t use any of the excuses I prepared to persuade them. Every time I stopped one senior citizen to ask them for a favor very carefully, not only would they agree to help without much hesitation, they also raised some questions that even me, the initiator and the conductor of the project, had never thought about. What result INDEED do I want to achieve by completing this project? Will there be any real change to the community? If not, what is the point of researching on it? What I discovered is that they, as the residents here, don’t care about how I analyze the case or whether this project creates a useful method in urban planning study; instead, the reason why they agreed to help is that they sincerely hope that my work could make some improvements, even the slightest. But what did I think? Ironically, I never intended to make an improvement plan, and were it not for them, it was very likely that my study would end with my analysis of the data I collected and some idealistic conclusions which had no influence to reality. Although with their cooperation, it didn’t take me much time to finish my task, but on my way back home, I had to rethink about the future of my project. Is a project that was entirely theoretical and had no actual applications something I want?It didn’t take me much time to have an answer.No.I started to re-plan my whole project; the data, the analysis, they are important, but still, they are merely one small step in the project. I had to make a plan that could improve the situation with the highest efficiency, and of course, could be applied to reality. To be specific, I needed to do more detailed surveys, I needed to go way deeper into the community, and I needed to observe it with a more anthropological perspective rather than a statistical one. When I finally took my improvement plan with me to talk to the community administration organization, I could see appreciation in their eyes, appreciation that a high school student could do research for the satisfaction of the world, instead of his own. Indeed, all the scientific researches, together pave a road to harmony of nature, to economic advance, to cultural diversity, and more importantly, to a near future full of expectations. I would call the path I experienced a road of social care for humans.",

For my project, I focused on the topic of the “home range” of senior citizens since aging is a very serious problem in this society. During this period, I started to understand that urban design was excitingly complicated, and requires both skills in statistics and also an understanding of the people that inhabit cities. For example, I had a breakthrough by using GPS devices to track the routes of senior citizens. This provided an empirical method to identify problematic roads in order to make informed improvements. Then, determined to submit recommendations to local committees, I found it necessary to incorporate the history and cultural background of residents. Ultimately, my urban studies project expanded my horizons and leads me follow the principle of being comprehensive. That’s the reason why I select urban studies as my concentration.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Community\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          My modeling contest team is one of the teams that give me sense of belonging.

    "CommonApp": "I am the Durian Queen. My mom, like many people, never liked durians. She doesn’t hide her disgust whenever she sees me eating it or wandering around durian stands at the market. She would frown, “It’s bulky, smelly, and covered by thorns.” In order to defend my favorite fruit, I once stared at a durian, trying to think of its positive points (and whether its points were a positive trait). I noticed its husk is tough yet its flesh soft; its repugnant odor doesn’t deter people whom like it from eating it. I was not simply looking at a fruit, but realizing something much more important about myself as a leader.As courage and toughness are required to lead, the hard tusk of a durian serves to demonstrate to people its force. Durian, while nutritional, also has other applications: its husk can be made into paper (via coir fiber) or used as natural mosquito repellent; its seeds pound into durian flour and chips. Like a durian, a leader must appear strong, convincing herself and others of her ability, and dedicate every bit of herself to maximizing the team’s benefit. My confidence as a leader was tested when my gymnastics team and I were competing in a national championship. Before our performance, one of my teammates hesitantly came to tell me that she was having a serious headache. Because I was nervous and unsure about our first national competition, instead of trying to negotiate with the staff to postpone, I encouraged her to do her best. During our performance she ended up falling down on stage. I allowed my fear and uncertainty to hinder my ability as a leader, and most importantly, I failed to protect my group member. Learning from my mistake, I started to build up my skills as a leader by being more determined and decisive. As Secretary General of MUN, I made sure to project confidence. After all, a durian’s formidable thorn-covered husk is not supposed to intimidate people, but instead to establish an impression of authority. When the tough tusk of a durian is opened, the soft and sweet flesh is visible. Similarly, when members of my club learn more about me, they find that though I appear tough, I am also friendly and willing to help whenever they ask me for advice. A leader is only as strong as the people she leads; so in order to lead well, she must support her team. A durian, with its strong odor, receives both criticism and resentment from many who regard it as a “low-class, stinky” fruit, similar to how sometimes my effort might not be understood, my decisions criticized, and my management questioned. A leader must always consider the goal of the group, as opposed to worrying about how well liked she is. Once, my friend was angry with me for publically criticizing her late arrival to rehearsal, but I did not show that it bothered me. Later, when I asked some team members, they agreed that the strict rules were ensuring the efficiency of rehearsal for everyone to save time. Blame is unavoidable, but it can also be beneficial, since it urges me to constantly introspect on my words, and decisions. Like how a person who ignores the odor of a durian will be able to enjoy its sweet flesh, a leader who understands the inevitability of blame, criticisms and misfortunes will be able to see the benefits it brings. Under the cover of a tough husk and thorns, I learn to be responsible, determined, and courageous. Resembling the soft sweet flesh of a durian, my friendly personality helps me get along with and understand my team members more. Shakespeare once wrote, “uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.” I suspect he knew that the Durian is sometimes referred to as the king of fruits.",
    "Supps": "题目：Why Penn\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          8:00 a.m., April 10, 2018, on my bed on the third floor of Riepe, sipping a cup of tea, I imagine myself wearing a black suit, cross-examining a witness. Having just declared my major in political science, I can see my remaining two years at Penn devoted to law school preparation, yet choosing the right courses is still a troubling task for me. ;Recalling my past two years, my involvements in the Penn community and academics have undoubtedly helped me become well versed in an array of fields. From sociology to performing arts courses, my experiences and professors have helped me to become more determined. With my potential major in mind, I enrolled in Poverty and Inequality in order to acquire a more comprehensive understanding of social justice and the role of laws in alleviating social problems. Discussing topics like poverty trends, labor markets, and anti-poverty policy programs in a small class setting, I not only gained a more personal relationship with Professor Regina Baker but also learned more about social inequality issues from a multitude of perspectives. In Rehearsal and Performance I learned through reading, improvisation, and scene study to improve my observation, cooperation, and communication skills. By studying acting techniques, reading the works of theorists, and practicing public speaking, I became a more confident storyteller. Hoping to develop my voice as a writer as well, I took Finding Voice: Perspectives on Race, Class and Gender. Through interviews, research, and writing exercises, I was able to not only use the conventions of academic writing to convey my opinions with my own voice, but also discover more about the issues and inquiries of minority groups. ;My learning at Penn also occurred outside the classroom. For a more direct approach to alleviating inequality issues, I joined Empty the Shelters to support the \"poor people's economic human rights campaign\" through direct work with the poor and by building a broad-based movement to end poverty. Our efforts focused on educating students and supporting the work of the Kensington Welfare Rights Union. Additionally, as a freshman excited about exchanging ideas, I joined both Penn Model Congress (PENNMC) and Penn Speech and Debate. PENNMC enhanced my understanding of American government, especially Congress and the legislative process, while Penn Speech Debate's varsity members taught me how to conduct parliamentary and policy debate. Watching the seniors competing in NFA-LD college circuit was an inspiring experience, as I learned more about different debating styles and improved my critical thinking, researching, and speaking skills. ;The tea has grown cold. I continue to meditate on my future choices. Browsing through names and descriptions of the courses, I can't make up my mind. Among copious courses within the Department of Political Science, Human Rights appeals to me, since the intricate relationship between the need of human beings and the development of law has always been the focus of the legislative process. Discussions on civil rights and women's rights can provide me with a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of public opinion on politics and laws. American Constitutional Law II also intrigues me, as I have grown curious about constitutional developments and the history of the struggles for equal rights. Furthermore, the instructor, Professor Rogers Smith, has interests that match my own: public law, civil rights, and political thought. With his help, I will develop a keen awareness about the rights of the disadvantaged and the further legislative effort required for the pursuit of equality. ;Engagement promotes progress, not only on the stage of politics but also in law. Looking forward to my next two years at Penn, I feel confident that I'm gradually being prepared for future studies in law school. More importantly, with my general education background and upcoming major courses, I know I will build up a sense of social responsibility, gain comprehensive awareness of global issues, and acquire a deeper insight into policy building and implementation. ;"

    "CommonApp": "My world is in a vintage Chinese wooden bookcase, basking in the sunshine of our apartment’s veranda. Those books form the world that helped me dream of exploring and making new discoveries in various fields of science, especially physics. It all began the summer after second grade. One hot day, I sat outside with the fan in front of me. My eyes started to wander around to find something interesting, and they landed on the bookcase. It was my father’s and the books were advanced, so I usually didn’t pay much attention to it. But this time, I noticed a dusty brown leather box placed at the bottom shelf. It piqued my curiosity. When I opened it, I was surprised to find notes for a physics class in my father’s clear handwriting. Excitedly, I pulled my chair close to the bookcase and began reading. Unlike those textbooks whose language is didactic and boring, my father’s notebook contained his own personal interpretation towards concepts. Seeing the way he solved questions and even sometimes had mistakes made me feel more closer to the notebook, and as I kept reading, I felt opened a new world filled with physics concepts. Though difficult, the contents were interesting enough for me to read with great patience I never had before. The development of astronomy, Newton’s era, and all those theories immediately made me curious to better understand the world. Besides the joy of exploring new knowledge, the subject also impressed me with its inherent logic and precise computation, All those scrupulous solutions to comprehend and analyze phenomena dwarfed my childish, random ways of thinking. Even if I didn’t understand a lot of what I read, that first impression paved a strong foundation for my love of science. Later, I started to spend a lot of my spare time sitting beside bookcase. I sat in my own world in that small corner of the veranda, learning interesting things I wouldn’t have been able to in class. The book Make: Electronics Learning by Discovery, for example, let me get a hands-on interpretation towards modern technology. I enjoyed experiments like making my own primitive lemon battery to light up several LEDs. Though honestly I wasted a lot of lemons, it made life more interesting for me.Through the years, the world of my father’s books helped me find and pursue my love for science. In college, I wish to further explore those appealing fields, especially physics. In the future, maybe I can apply the theories I learn to modern technologies, or do further research in areas like quantum mechanics. Although I’ll leave that vintage bookcase behind one day, with all my father’s books, the inspiration I got there will still remain.",

It has helped me become a stronger person, always ready to face my problems directly.When I first heard of aerobics in middle school, I was immediately attracted by the vigorous attitude of the dance and the group members. Later, as the leader, I was proud to help everyone prepare for important competitions, whether it was teaching them how to feel the music or remember all the patterns or bringing them together like a family. However, outside of the team I wasn’t as confident.Early in middle school, a few classmates started making fun of my reading. \"Look, she's reading Scarlet Letter! Isn't she pretentious? I don't believe people can enjoy reading those boring novels.\"I told myself the comments would go away if I just ignore them. But they continued until slowly, all my classmates started to isolate me. During this time, I devoted myself even more into aerobics, my refuge. With my welcoming teammates and the energetic music surrounding me, I felt like I could do anything.Then on Sports Day in 8th grade, I got excited when a classmate invited me to attend the competitions, thinking maybe they wanted to fix the problems and to be friends again. Brimming with excitement, I sat among my classmates on the bleachers as they discussed the day's competitions. For the first time in a while, I found the confidence to speak up, but immediately they stopped their conversation, acting as if I was a stranger. How embarrassed I felt.I rushed out of school as fast as I could, running until I arrived home. Turning on the tap and let the water cool my face, I felt a little better.With a clear head, I asked myself: Against the bullies, why couldn't I be the same person as in aerobics, so energetic and charismatic? At that moment, I made a decision to live in a new way.I reminded myself that I was a confident leader, and finally confronted those classmates who made hurtful remarks. We held a conversation and I was surprised to find out that at first they wanted to interact with me more, but when they saw that I ignored them, their comments became hurtful. When I told them how I felt, they started to regret what they did, and even apologized. Although we never became very close, we started getting along better over the next year. Other classmates also felt more comfortable talking to me in class, and my school life improved. Most importantly, it was so simple.My experience taught me that difficulties only fester when I leave them alone, and that I must actively challenge them instead. Aerobics helped me discover my positive and energetic self, and reminds me not to let fear and difficulties turn me into a shy individual. Today, I am more outspoken and expressive than ever: I love telling interesting stories and sharing in the new friendly atmosphere with my classmates. With the active attitude I got from aerobics, I am now brave enough to triumph over obstacles as I strive after my goals in life."

That elegant handwriting with its clear train of thoughts excited me and made me start to spend lots of spare time reading through all. From the primitive exploration of astronomy to the operation theories of modern technologies, my father’s personal interpretation of physics concepts and his way of solving problems opened a new world for me. Through that notebook, for the first time I heard the concept of microcosms, worlds that cannot be observed directly by human eyes. Though difficult, I read with great patience I never had before and asked my father lots of questions about what I read. ;While learning about concepts like Maxwell’s equations, I discovered that the field I was interested in is called quantum mechanics, and it covers what cannot even be explained by classic physics. Really curious to learn more, I kept reading and discovered that study of these things that couldn’t be seen had actually been applied to many accomplishments in real world: 50 years ago, the first transistor was invented based on its knowledge. Then, the super precise clock, quantum cryptography and laser beam all appeared subsequently, thus improving the progress of humans’ living conditions. Excited about this amazing field and its potential in real world, I decided on my goal of studying quantum mechanics in-depth and applying its special principles, such as uncertainty, interference and entanglement, into modern technology. ;In CMU’s supportive environment, with the impressive physics department I can not only study advanced theories of quantum mechanics but also learn more about its experiments and applications. Classes in the computational physics track will allow me to use computers to effectively simulate and study the movement of those tiny particles that otherwise are invisible and unpredictable to humans. When I have questions about this complex subject, the Academic Development program also can provide me support from helpful peers with walk-in tutoring or the EXCEL study groups. With these great programs I can not only learn well but also join the passionate community of science students at CMU.Once I have mastered class materials, by joining research projects at the DarkLab, I can get an even deeper understanding of the features that intrigue me through helpful experiments. There I’ll further my understanding about things like the spin of quantum and its relationship with gravitational field. Using all this knowledge, I can help do further research in fields like Quantum Communication, which can connect humans across the world immediately, at the Pittsburgh Research Center. By deepening my knowledge in quantum mechanics through these special and advanced research opportunities at CMU, I will have a good foundation to one day do my own research promoting the development of useful modern technologies.With a minor in CS at Carnegie Mellon, I can achieve additional depth and breadth in the field of quantum mechanics. Courses such as Computer Graphics will teach me how to create and manipulate even better visualizations of data, an essential part of quantum research. By following the guidance of distinguished professors, using programs I can even trace the tracks of invisible particles or establish the ideal environment for experiments.I would fully utilize the valuable resources provided by Carnegie Mellon to further explore application of various physics theories. In the future, by using technology to advance in the field of quantum mechanics, I hope to help in discoveries that will make the world become more convenient and progressive."

    "CommonApp": "“Becoming Untagged”Shanghai was just a forty-five-minute bus ride away from Songjiang, the suburb where I grew up, but to me it was like a different world. After my weekly English and piano lessons, I’d explore the city’s bustling streets, marveling at the eclectic mix of Western cafes, modern high-rises, and Chinese teahouses in the French Concession.  But inevitably, the crowds of indifferent strangers would begin to intimidate me and my excitement would drain away. I’d become self-conscious, awkwardly trying to imitate the city-dwellers’ manners and attitudes, but feeling like a tourist inside.  With a sigh, I’d head for the bus station for the ride home.These weekly bus rides came to a halt after my family moved into an apartment downtown. Finally, I could say I lived in the real Shanghai. Yet even so, I still found myself emphasizing my outsider status. I attributed my poor math scores to the fact that I didn’t grow up with a math tutor like my classmates. When I won an English competition, I’d congratulate myself as the suburban underdog who’d outperformed the city kids.  I thought this way until sixth grade, when I volunteered to be the English class representative. Having to collect homework and assist the teacher forced me to talk to the classmates I had worked so hard to keep at a distance. To help one classmate out, I started making him a weekly quiz that many other students also ended up taking over our lunch break. During one session, I met Victor and learned about his interest in drama. I invited him to be my partner for the school’s dubbing competition. To my surprise, I found that he was from Songjiang too. In fact, when I was signing a student information form, I realized that many of my “urban” classmates were also from other provinces.  It gradually became clear to me that my classmates were individuals, with their own stories and identities. Why, I wondered, had I been so quick to lump them under one “tag”? For that matter, why had I been so quick to tag myself as an outsider, when no one really treated me as one? I began to realize that it wasn’t my classmates’ fault that I felt like a “suburban girl.” In my insecurity, I was the one who’d chosen to cling to this label.For the first time, I began to think of the person I had become in my community. I am the girl who is famous for being a nutrition nerd, sitting in the back row in order to secretly design nutrition courses with my deskmate, whom I instantly connected with when I learned about his involvement in diabetes education. I am the girl who is known for being cheerful and helpful, and yet always ends up playing the villain in our school dramas, whether it’s the sinister Lady Macbeth or a martinet of a Tiger Mother. I am the girl who gets nervous just making the daily announcements in my role as class monitor, yet who can’t wait to arrange a presentation of my pictures and thoughts from my vacation trip. I am the girl who stays up late studying, but spends the period before an exam lying on the grass with my best friend, staring up through the branches at the tranquil blue sky.      My identity card will always say “Songjiang” on it, but I now know that I am more than just an area code. I may never have a neat answer for the question, “Who am I?”  But I now understand that identity is self-defined, and self-directed. It’s only when we shed our “tags,” whether those of race, religion, or nationality, that we can truly embrace others and find our shared values. I look at myself and others without tags now, and I like what I see.",
    "Supps": "题目：How have your experiences influenced you to consider the College of Human Ecology and how will your choice of major impact your goals and plans for the future? (650)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          My interest in Nutritional Science was ignited by my ninth grade biology class, where I first learned about the digestive system and the mechanisms of heart disease. Fascinated by the consequences of unhealthy eating, I became further interested in Nutritional Science after learning about the effects of diet on epigenetics in the book “Survival of the Sickest.” My readings revealed to me the complex relationship between food and health, and convinced me to study nutrition formally in college.  ;Cornell’s CHE is my top choice for reasons beyond its rigorous scientific education. I spent three weeks at Martha Van Rensselaer Hall last summer, taking a course called “Body, Mind, and Health.” The lectures and readings about the different treatments for tuberculosis in male and female patients and the complex bio-psychosocial causes of anorexia nervosa gave me the mind-opening perspective that health issues go beyond pure biology. Attracted by the college’s interdisciplinary, holistic approach to health, I knew that CHE is where I want to be for the next four years.What specifically connects me to CHE and the Nutritional Science major is our shared belief that nutrition is a contemporary health challenge whose solutions require “making connections to creatively solve problems.” I’ve come to recognize that in China, my home country, there is little attempt to educate children about nutrition. Because I strongly believe that healthy eating habits must be taught and formed at a young age, I initiated a nutrition project in 10th grade. In addition to designing classes to teach kids basic nutritional facts, I wanted to try an interactive, artistic approach, since I suspected that kids would learn better as active participants than as passive listeners. Therefore, I designed creative activities, which ranged from drawing a “Nutrition Man” made of healthy foods to creating a comic strip about a family with unhealthy eating habits, for kids in different grades. Furthermore, I guided kids to apply their knowledge to their daily lives through activities such as creating a do-it-yourself salad with their parents. The results were encouraging: I watched as the kids took more active roles in food preparation at home and more responsibilities for their bodies. I’ve emerged from my project with the insight that kids learn best when placed at the center of their learning experience, and that ingenuity is an essential part of any successful nutrition project. Recognizing CHE’s same emphasis on the human experience and creative problem solving, I consider CHE the perfect place for me to continue fostering connections between food and people. ;In my future career, I want to focus on Nutrition Communications and Dietetics. Thus, I’ve decided to enter the Didactic Program in Dietetics to complement my primary course of study. Naturally, I will take courses like “Maternal and Child Nutrition” and “Nutrition and the Life Cycle,” within my major. I also plan to take advantage of CHE’s flexible curriculum to enroll in Human Development classes, to better understand learning mechanisms and decision making, essential components of developing effective nutrition education programs for children. CHE’s philosophy is that knowledge is meant to be applied, and I wholeheartedly agree: I therefore also intend to participate in hands-on projects, such as the Urban Semester in New York City.  ;Working with service programs such as Motivating Action through Community Health Outreach (MAChO) will allow me to promote healthy living among disadvantaged youths in North Brooklyn, thus directly impacting people’s lives.Ultimately, my goal is to have a positive impact on family health, using educational activities and expert advice to guide families to achieve healthy eating practices at home. I believe that an education at Cornell’s CHE will give me the ability to design solutions to help people live healthier and better lives."

    "CommonApp": "My dad is the son of a peasant. I am the daughter of a respectable physician. The worlds we come from couldn’t be more different, yet the way they affected us is remarkably similar.Growing up, I’d listen to stories of the poverty my dad experienced in that far-off village. “Back then,” my dad told me, “People would smash in the face of their own relative just for an egg to eat. They couldn’t see beyond the instant gains and opportunities in front of them.”Fortunately my dad was different. When his siblings quit school to work in the fields or factories, my dad borrowed loans to attend medical college in a distant city. Though lacking the formal education of many of his peers, he worked with the humble diligence of a countryman, and eventually went on to become an expert in his field, boldly introducing a new medical technology to his hospital. Even outside of work, he never fears experiencing challenges. In his thirties, he saw a golf club for the first time and fell in love with the sport. Though self-training plateaus sometimes made him want to throw his clubs away, he somehow managed to become an excellent amateur player. Similarly, two years ago he became interested in fitness. Though his fitness journey brought constant injuries and pains, he can now run a marathon and do 100 perfect push-ups. “Your dad’s a dreamer,” my mom concluded, “but he is stubborn enough to pull them through.”Influenced by my dad’s experiences and attitudes, I found myself inheriting his dreamer spirit. In China, where education is geared at vocational training, academic interests that don’t ensure a lucrative job are usually discouraged. Yet in spite of this environment, I somehow I gained a passion towards humanities and arts. I find joy in the subtle beauty of the rhyme and rhythm of 1900s Chinese novels. When studying World History,  I love combing over small facts and details in my efforts to understand unknown cultures and decipher historical trends. Some may say history and literature lack practicality, but I stubbornly believe humanities and arts are as valuable as STEM, and I long to continue studying this subject that gives us a better understanding of enigmatic human nature. With his resources, my dad could help provide me a promising career as a physician. Yet, whenever someone mentions this possibility, dad and I just glance at each other playfully, because we both realize our paths are parallel; they were never meant to intersect, always just a small distance apart, both guided by the same far-off destination—one full of unknowns—in pursuit of our dreams.I always marvel at the mystery of genetics, which buried identical core values beneath the different interests of dad and I. The two of us are willing to struggle on the path less traveled and ignore doubts and other’s expectations. With faith in our choices and sweat on our brows, we march forward in our ideal direction with a huge smile and endless determination.",

The breeze sweeps across my cheeks and my dark skin shines bronze in the sunlight. My body moves smooth and relaxed, each muscle stretched with elegance.I love these imaginations of running majestically in far off destinations. In reality though, I am a normal Chinese single child, having no connection with the wild women in my fantasy. Worse, I wasn’t even born athletic and only began running because of weight issues. However, this most basic activity unexpectedly became my greatest adventure.For a long period, running was a tough task for me. Each daily jog was a battle with the lazy girl inside me, and countless times I wanted to quit. Yet, acting as my own coach, I’d yell at myself, “Don’t stop! Keep going!” and would continue throwing my legs forward, cruelly but proudly.Over time though, the runs became easier. 5 km. 10 km. 15 km. Even after my original weight loss goal was achieved, I kept running. I would run in the summer though the fierce sunlight stabbing my skin, and through the biting winter winds that left my fingers chilled and frozen. ;Soon, I’d graduated from a little, shy fatty into someone fit, confident, and strong-minded. The conversations with myself while running were no longer intense quarrels, but resembled chats between old companions. The ache in my legs no longer made me feel desperation, and the heat burning my lungs didn’t result in thoughts of giving up. I learnt to not be afraid of being hurt and gained the bravery to challenge and try to surpass my limits.As a single child, I’d always lived in my comfort zone, like a potted plant neatly shaven and protected from bumps or bruises. I was groomed for a very predictable future: graduate from a decent Chinese university, enter a respectable local company, then work in the same position until I retire. I would live happily and easily. Yet, there would be nothing other than dinners and weekends to look forward to everyday, and eventually that bold, wild woman in my heart would weaken and wither away.Fortunately, I’ve begun to stretch out of the greenhouse, because by running, I’ve learned that some joys and achievements can’t be felt without pain, risks, or challenges. They are all nutrients that give the woman inside me the strength to passionately yell, “Go! Go sign up of a marathon and finish it strong. Go to another country and study the most challenging, interesting courses.  ;Go……” My heart beats fast for her words, yearning to experience all of those prodigious aches and joys.Honestly I’m still afraid of failures and obstacles. Yet I’ve gained courage to confront them, because deep in my soul there is a bold woman who can run to her destination through the pain, through the plains, through the hills, never stopping."

    "CommonApp": "Sometimes when jogging on the school tracks, I suddenly imagine myself as a wild woman running barefooted on an unbounded plain. The breeze sweeps gently across my cheeks, and my dark skin shines bronze under the warm sunlight. My entire body moves smooth and relaxed, every muscle stretched with elegance.I love these imaginations of running majestically in far off destinations. In reality though, I am a normal Chinese single child, having no connection with the wild aboriginals in my fantasy. Worse, I wasn’t even born athletic. I began running because of weight issues, and because I couldn’t play any other sports well. However, this most basic and simple activity unexpectedly became my greatest adventure.For a long period, running was a tough task for me. Each daily jog was a battle with the lazy girl inside me. Armed with an extremely stern expression, I would ignore her pleas for mercy as I marched gravely into the summer heat. Her resistance would become increasingly fierce as I reached the halfway point of my run, when my leg muscles would join the rebellion. However, after giving up and restarting several times, my desire to slim down was gradually replaced by an unwillingness to be beaten by myself.  As my own coach, I’d yell at myself, “Don’t stop! Keep going!” and I’d continue throwing my legs forward, cruelly but proudly.Over time, the runs became easier. 5 km. Then 10 km. Then 15 km. Even after my clothes shrunk two sizes and my original weight loss goal disappeared, I kept running. I would run in the summer though the fierce sunlight stabbing my skin, and run through the rain pouring down in summer typhoons. When winter came, I’d to wrestle with the biting wind that left my fingers as stiff and chilled as frozen worms. Soon, I’d graduated from that little, shy fatty into someone fit, confident, and strong-minded. The conversations with myself while running were no longer intense quarrels, but resembled chats between old companions, supporting each other through their toughest moments. The ache in my legs no longer made me feel panic and desperation. The heat burning my lungs didn’t result in thoughts of giving up. I learnt to stay with pain but not suffer, to not be afraid of being hurt. I gained the bravery to challenge my extremes and try to surpass them. As a single child, I’d always lived in my comfort zone, like a potted plant neatly shaven and well cared for, protected from bumps or bruises. I was groomed for a very predictable and safe future: graduate from a decent Chinese university, enter a respectable local company, then work in the same position until I retire. I would live happily and easily. Yet, there would be nothing other than dinners and weekends to look forward to everyday. Meanwhile, the wild woman in my heart would be slowly weakened and finally die when I was no longer touched by the poster of HWY163. Fortunately, I’ve begun to stretch out of the greenhouse and attempt to bear the storm, heat, and chill, because by running, I’ve learned that some joys and achievements can’t be felt without pain, risks, or challenges. They are all nutrients that feed the woman inside me. They give her the strength to passionately yell, “Go! Practice for a marathon and finish it strong. Go to another country and study the most challenging, interesting courses. Go travel through the Pan-American Highway like Ernesto Guevara. Go……” My heart beats fast for her words, yearning to experience all of those prodigious aches and joys.Honestly I’m still afraid of failures knocking me down and obstacles punching me in the face. However, I won’t be stopped or crushed by them, because deep in my soul there is a bold woman who can run to her destination through the pain, through the plains, through the hills, never stopping.",
    "Supps": "题目：Describe your academic interests and how you plan to pursue them at USC. Please feel free to address your first- and second-choice major selections (250 word limit).\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Media enchants me. It is a form of communication even more effective than language, perfectly conveying a producer’s intentions through sounds, images, and words. Yet, achieving this desired affect is challenging, a fact I learned first hand during my internship at the Shenzhen Media Group (SZMG). ;Shadowing my SZMG mentor, I’d spend my days rushing around the city recording the latest news events, then hurrying back into the office to edit the footage for broadcast. Observing the production process, I was impressed by the care taken with each frame angle and the wording of each manuscript. Yet, even at a professional studio, I saw how hard it is to perfectly express ideas through film. Formulaic editing sometimes made our broadcasts stiff and rigid, and ineffective use of limited resources often forced workers to sacrifice aesthetics and accuracy. While our successes made me happy, our failures made me even more determined to learn the necessary skills and knowledge to improve in my craft.I thus wish to study media through the Bryan Singer Division at USC so that I can continue to learn how to fully harness the potential of media. I want to explore its theoretical foundations and its historical significance. I want to witness how the real-world media industry works and how it uses media to communicate. At USC, with its prolific history in media studies and strong connection to the modern industry, I can get one step closer to producing pieces that truly represent my vision.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：The Cinematic Arts personal statement should be a carefully prepared explanation of the applicant’s goals, describing any film, television, scholarly, critical or other creative background, as well as career objectives. It should present a clear and accurate picture of the applicant, outline objectives in the field of cinema and media studies and explain how attending the School of Cinematic Arts will help reach these goals.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          The first fictional work to ever make me cry in the theatre was Cloud Atlas. I can’t say I even understood all of the metaphorical messages hidden in the film, but what I definitely knew was how real this movie was. The deepest sorrow, humblest hope, painful confusion, and helpless love between characters were so natural and lively on the screen, making me feel as if I were experiencing exactly what happened in the story. At that moment I realized for the first time that movies are not just entertainment, but rather an art with considerable impact and power.The impression this film left on me inspired my interest in film and media. Thus, when offered a chance to enter the school TV station in senior high, I took it without hesitation. For two years I worked tirelessly, turning myself from a layperson to the manager of the station. My main jobs were writing and producing, however, in order to be an adept manager I was also involved in nearly every aspect of our broadcasts. I still remember the hours spent staring at our lone SLR trying to create the illusion of multiple camera positions, or nights when my teammates and I brainstormed how to disguise the amateurism of our actors through scene design. Now as station manager, I supervise the work of six teams on different programs, and looking back, I can claim tens if not hundreds of standardized broadcasts and original videos as my productions. While they may not all be “professional quality”, they are accomplishments that I, as an amateur filmmaker, feel proud of. ;As I become more experienced in film, however, I have become more critical. Recently, I went back and reviewed some of my favorite movies—Forrest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption and of course, Cloud Atlas.  ;Now with my own media experience, I am able to recognize the montage used in narrative, the details in character development, the transitions between different episodes, and the framing of every shot. I think back to that moment in the theatre watching Cloud Atlas and can now appreciate the sophisticated execution that allowed the producers to project their intended thoughts and emotions without loss or alteration through the movies complicated, majestic composition. Looking at these masterpieces, then revisiting my own works, I feel unsatisfied. I’ve been able to create some romantic scenes or complete a story using my entry-level SLR and editing software, but they are still not living and breathing things; there is a separation between the thoughts and feelings I want to tell. Only when this gap is filled, with time, effort and experience, can my true intentions smoothly emerge as a complete work and appear vividly on the screen.These abilities are not easily mastered, but require creative instinct, specific knowledge, and decades of practice. Therefore, what I seek through the Bryan Singer Cinema & Media Studies program are not some ready-made procedures about how to make great movies, but the knowledge, resources and practice to gradually become a better film-maker. The program provides study in both commercial productions and artistic creations, and explores both advanced technology and classical approaches towards media and film. Also, through theory classes, I am eager to explore how human culture interacts with media and gain a deeper insight into how and what I want to create and the impact it can have. Most importantly, to make powerful work, I need not only theoretical knowledge of cinematic arts, but also substantial involvement in professional, industrial productions. From the “hands-on” projects to faculty with years of real industry experience, the Cinema &Media Studies program provides a practical environment for students to learn and create. ;At USC’s Bryan Singer Division, I believe I can become truly versed in media and begin telling my own great stories, finally presenting the same thrill I experienced watching Cloud Atlas in that dark theatre years ago.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：The writing sample should be a review or analysis of some aspect of film, television, or new media; a discussion or application of critical theory; or a published article.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          The qualification of Forrest Gump as a classic cinematic work has long been controversial. Despite its huge success at the 1995 Oscar and sterling reviews amongst spectators, journalistic critiques still show a subtle disdain towards it. It seems Forrest Gump finds itself in the same slightly embarrassing position as Liszt’s music: It is found everywhere, known by everyone, but is it a deep, enduring masterpiece? Opinions vary. ;Forrest Gump is basically the momentous events in 20th US History as seen through the eyes of a mentally handicapped man, whose characterization brings humor and encouraging factors to the film. Since the protagonist, Forrest Gump, is mainly a flat character reflecting traditional social values, this movie actually doesn’t aim at displaying internal conflicts and personal growths of the main character as most biographical films do. Instead it is closer to a historical account of American history through memories. Due to Forrest’s unassuming nature and socially conservative vantage point on historical events, the support and favor Forrest Gump wins seem more a result of the movie’s accordance to public tastes, not its actual artistic achievement. However its level of fame and worldwide influence definitely could not be achieved simply by responding to mainstream demands.The effect movies have on a spectator are dependent on their mechanisms of representation, including the transcription, camera and editing, and other methods to convert ideas on the pages into tangible medium. It is evident that the success of Forrest Gump isn’t a fluke, but results from impeccable execution. Specifically, the employment of flashbacks and voice over, the hooks and clues connecting the entire work, and the characterization have all become classical imagery in cinematic arts. From overall narrative to carefully designed details, Forrest Gump interprets and symbolizes traditional ideology but in a creative and unique way.Consider the movie’s structure. What classifies Forrest Gump from an epic film is the incorporation of personal experience and domestic history. Though the accounts of so many events risk turning into a bullet-point list, Robert Zemeckis skillfully avoids two possible downfalls: a blank biography without spiritual reflection or a lengthy chronicle lacking originality. Instead he gets the right balance between Forrest’s involvement in national events and the development of his relationship with Jenny. Thus, neither of the two main factors of this movie, the country and the individual, overpowers the other, but complement one another’s deficiencies. Forrest is elevated from a limited individual to a representative figure of America, while the playful, entertaining tone telling his personal life links the historical episodes without unnatural transition and  ;lack of emotions. This balance is exactly what make this movie acceptable while not going so far as to be overly frivolous. ;Another factor contributing to Forrest Gump’s success, which is even more remarkable, is the expressive details. One very artful and unique technique is the use of archive footage. Robert Zemeckis ’s insistence on never using actors to display historical figures required huge efforts on the part of the visual effect department, yet the effort ultimately produced Zemecki’s desire effect— a natural way to combine the experiences of Forrest and America. Even when displaying fictional plots set in the past, the director used the most concise scenes to restore the history. The group of frames describing the family history of Lieutenant Dan can serve as a good example: only a clip of each generation are shown, allowing for minimal historical inaccuracy, while all the elements such as the clothing and surroundings in those shots are exactly in accordance to history. Those small details are invaluable: the more careful the details and complete the representation of reality, the stronger ideological impact and empathetic response the movie will draw from the spectator.While vibrantly reflecting real history, the movie also has a strong central ideology through its winding plot. Forrest Gump has long been considered as a promotion of conservatism for its positive portrayal of loyalty, faith, family and other traditional values. But even beyond those elements, there are still apolitical depictions of the country spirit of the USA as well as the universal human nature. Forrest himself is a successful man grown from a weak, disable child, and can be regarded as a symbol of America, which developed from a dependent colony to an international power with military and economic success. The famous quote “ I am not a smart man, but I know love,” is a straightforward but still touching conclusion of the movie’s emphasis on positive human sentiments. Even the world-famous feather can be considered as a metaphor of life, though interpretations vary from the randomness of experience to the fate of individuals.Indeed there are probably no extremely abstract philosophical ideas in Forrest Gump, but undeniably it is a successful case of how mechanisms in movie production can drastically alter the ideological and empathetic impact on spectators."

    "CommonApp": "In second grade, I colored the ocean purple. Not in rebellion, but rather because I was too disinterested to discern the blues from the purples, the grays from the browns. My artistic efforts always disappointed my patient mother, who yearned to fill the house with cute drawings. But, even then my perspective on life was different. I was serious and focused; drawing felt like a waste of time. In my young mind, there was no future in art. Blink. Junior year and I am an exchange student in New York. Much to my dismay, the school required that I take a studio art course. Immediately, my mind jumped to the end of the semester; a giant “D” on my report card, my GPA a mangled wreck and the dream of attending a top college lost. In class, I tried, I really did. But, drawings of planes looked like ducks and please, do not get me started on my attempt at a self-portrait. My eyes resembled flying-saucers and my ear – a stalk of corn. (Yes, I used the singular. I forgot to include a second ear). Distressed, I went to the teacher and begged for my type of relief. I offered to take a test, on Van Gogh, on Impressionism, on Cubism on anything that involved me studying, memorizing and writing. “Test taking,” I assured the teacher with a broad smile on my face, “is my form of art.” My hope for a resolution to the problem dissolved when she grabbed my hand and pulled me into storage room where samples of student work were stored. Immediately, I felt a slow sense of exasperation making its way up to my throat. I looked around at the pieces, each so colorful and accomplished. “But these students are all in college studying art,” I protested. To my surprise, the teacher made it clear that nearly all of the pieces were created by students who were not art majors. Staring at their works, I understood that I needed to change my perspective. That night as I gazed at a blank white sheet of paper I realized that the class was requiring me to give up the safety net of notes and outlines; memorization and formula. I actually laughed out loud when I realized that the art class had nothing to do with art! I was the only one thinking that, in some way, I had to create a perfect painting to get a good grade. In fact, I was the only one in the class talking about grades at all! All the other students were joyously bringing their vision to life! My job, my only responsibility, was to think abstractly, create energetically and free my mind from the pressing concerns about grades, college applications, career and the giant storm of confusion that is the future. Armed with this realization, I threw myself into painting. Rather than ask about my grade I began asking about contrast, contour and – of course – perspective. Sadly, my planes still looked like ducks and I constantly forgot to include a second ear on my portraits; but these gaffs became topics of discussion. Was I making a comment on mankind’s ability to listen? Could planes be more environmentally friendly? I never created anything good enough to be preserved in the back storage room. But that is ok. My art was so bad – absurd even – that it generated great discussions –as teachers and classmates tried to makes sense of my world. I still think there is no future in art but I now understand that art is what makes the present so interesting. And, that is where I need to spend more time – living in the present, not worrying about the future but trying to master a new art: the art of living.",

In order to achieve this goal, I sought out the support of China’s professional media outlets. For the first time ever, students were empowered to report on activities from a student’s perspective. With hard work and dedication, Pharos reported on a variety of events, all deserving of people’s attention. Thanks to our efforts, students from all over China learned about new events and got up to date information on opportunities to help. ;"

    "CommonApp": "Sometimes when jogging on the school tracks, I suddenly imagine myself as a wild woman running barefooted on an unbounded plain. The breeze sweeps gently across my cheeks, and my dark skin shines bronze under the warm sunlight. My entire body moves smooth and relaxed, every muscle stretched with elegance.I love these imaginations of running majestically in far off destinations. In reality though, I am a normal Chinese single child, having no connection with the wild aboriginals in my fantasy. Worse, I wasn’t even born athletic. I began running because of weight issues, and because I couldn’t play any other sports well. However, this most basic and simple activity unexpectedly became my greatest adventure.For a long period, running was a tough task for me. Each daily jog was a battle with the lazy girl inside me. Armed with an extremely stern expression, I would ignore her pleas for mercy as I marched gravely into the summer heat. Her resistance would become increasingly fierce as I reached the halfway point of my run, when my leg muscles would join the rebellion. However, after giving up and restarting several times, my desire to slim down was gradually replaced by an unwillingness to be beaten by myself.  As my own coach, I’d yell at myself, “Don’t stop! Keep going!” and I’d continue throwing my legs forward, cruelly but proudly.Over time, the runs became easier. 5 km. Then 10 km. Then 15 km. Even after my clothes shrunk two sizes and my original weight loss goal disappeared, I kept running. I would run in the summer though the fierce sunlight stabbing my skin, and run through the rain pouring down in summer typhoons. When winter came, I’d to wrestle with the biting wind that left my fingers as stiff and chilled as frozen worms. Soon, I’d graduated from that little, shy fatty into someone fit, confident, and strong-minded. The conversations with myself while running were no longer intense quarrels, but resembled chats between old companions, supporting each other through their toughest moments. The ache in my legs no longer made me feel panic and desperation. The heat burning my lungs didn’t result in thoughts of giving up. I learnt to stay with pain but not suffer, to not be afraid of being hurt. I gained the bravery to challenge my extremes and try to surpass them. As a single child, I’d always lived in my comfort zone, like a potted plant neatly shaven and well cared for, protected from bumps or bruises. I was groomed for a very predictable and safe future: graduate from a decent Chinese university, enter a respectable local company, then work in the same position until I retire. I would live happily and easily. Yet, there would be nothing other than dinners and weekends to look forward to everyday. Meanwhile, the wild woman in my heart would be slowly weakened and finally die when I was no longer touched by the poster of HWY163. Fortunately, I’ve begun to stretch out of the greenhouse and attempt to bear the storm, heat, and chill, because by running, I’ve learned that some joys and achievements can’t be felt without pain, risks, or challenges. They are all nutrients that feed the woman inside me. They give her the strength to passionately yell, “Go! Practice for a marathon and finish it strong. Go to another country and study the most challenging, interesting courses. Go travel through the Pan-American Highway like Ernesto Guevara. Go……” My heart beats fast for her words, yearning to experience all of those prodigious aches and joys.Honestly I’m still afraid of failures knocking me down and obstacles punching me in the face. However, I won’t be stopped or crushed by them, because deep in my soul there is a bold woman who can run to her destination through the pain, through the plains, through the hills, never stopping.",

It helped me see that this is a place of boldness, that pioneers revolutionary studies and brings their impacts to the real world.Reading through Oberlin student blogs, I realize this spirit is actually born from the vibrant intellectual atmosphere and opportunities to put these intellectual ideas into practice. With few class requirements, Obies have the freedom to explore their academic interests in a place where vibrant discussions happen even outside of the classroom and constant questioning and reflection are daily habits. With the school motto “learning and labor”, Obies don’t just think, but also do amazing things, exerting tangible effects on the surrounding neighborhoods by establishing learning communities through unique programs like ExCO. With this kind of environment, I can understand why Oberlin has consistently presented revolutionary ideas to influence American society and the world.I’m someone who marvels at how physics dominates our world, who has endless questions about the causes of historical events, and who is enchanted by the rhythm of 1900s Chinese novels. I dream of challenge the unknowns, for both myself and society, and yearn to learn in a place like Oberlin, which involve so much passion, engagement, and hand-on opportunities. Here I would take the advantage of this intellectually lively environment, and boldly pursue my passion of human knowledge and my earnest desire to push its boundaries forward."

    "CommonApp": "“Please implement a feature to check whether students have actually seen their homework,” a teacher asked.This was the fifth time I had received a request to add a feature to our platform, which allows teachers to post assignments for students online. We had launched the beta version of our platform for both teachers and students, hoping to get their advice to quickly improve the platform. We initially invited about 10 teachers to our platform; however, due to our slow progress in changing the code, only three teachers remained. We wanted to make quick modifications to retain our teacher users, but as a computer science guy, I was instantly aware that making this change would require tracking users' scroll bars, which can be used to re-visualize exactly what’s happening on a user’s screen, almost equivalent to quietly installing malware to record our users’ screens when they are using our platform.“You know, the students are making up excuses for not doing homework,” the teacher said.My memory flashed back to an incident in middle school. In the middle of a math class, there was an unexpected ring of a mobile phone. The math teacher angrily demanded the student, we never knew who it was, admit his or her error. There was no response. Later, the homeroom teacher ordered some of my best friends to clandestinely search for the student's schoolbag in the suspected areas of the ringing phone. All of my friends thought that was bad, but they still obeyed the order because they were afraid of the teachers’ criticism. I don’t know if I had been chosen whether I would have challenged the teacher, but I think I would at least have chosen not to tell the teacher if I did find evidence of which phone was ringing. If I was not brave enough to blatantly reject the request, at least I could have resisted passively.“So that I can check whether they are lying,” the teacher explained.I hated the request. It was like asking me to install a telescreen from the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four into every student's computer. I didn't want to be the one who instilled fear into every student, including myself, that an \"inappropriate\" movement of the scroll bar could be used as evidence against him or her. I didn't want to have users self-censor their online behavior only to avoid being detected by my \"telescreen.\" I didn't want to be Big Brother, abusing the power granted him by the authorities. And, there was no passive workaround this time. It would have been impossible for me to always tell the teachers everyone had or had not seen the homework.I knew if I refused the request we risked losing one-third of our teacher users and the platform, I had spent three months coding, could soon become a ghost town. I could imagine being a “shrewd” businessman, implementing the requested feature, selling the idea to teachers that our platform could track anything they wanted, reminding them not to tell students about it. I could imagine how to write the code. I could see the function names, the actual code and the database structure flowing through my mind. I could build the \"telescreen\" in an hour. But instead, I imagined pressing Ctrl + A and DEL and erased all those imaginings from my mind, answering the teacher with a resolute \"no.",
    "Supps": "题目：Cornell Engineering celebrates innovative problem solving that helps people, communities … the world. Consider your ideas and aspirations and describe how a Cornell Engineering education would allow you to leverage technological problem-solving to improve the world we live in. (Please limit your response to 650 words.)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Years ago, I really knew nothing about artificial intelligence except its difficulty, but I speculated that trying to achieve AI would require a team of top experts from each academic subject working together to decode the human mind. In 2013, I happened to find a tech blog about a really simple algorithm for generating an abstract for an article. Surprisingly, no understanding of linguistics was required to understand the algorithm: Only mathematics, basic statistics and information theory were needed. That simple algorithm made AI less intimidating to me. ;That same summer, I had an argument with a classmate who is really good at psychological analysis. He claimed he knew what I thought by looking at my face, but that I couldn't figure out what he thought at all. I knew nothing about psychology, but I was unwilling to admit it. I threw out an unsubstantiated claim: “my computer can.”In retrospect, my childish claim was trash, but the idea is not. Those three-words, my computer can, have dominated my research direction in high school: using only computer science and math to solve problems that once only the human mind could solve. Finally in 2016, I had a small achievement. After many years reading famous papers on artificial intelligence, I solely used machine learning techniques to predict the evolution of future user interests on Quora.My research experience was like me against the world. I had almost no support from my family because they were either unfamiliar with the topic or thought it would distract me from school. When I asked classmates at school to work on the project collectively, their typical reply was “why don’t you learn some psychology instead?” I know I wouldn't have to face such problems at Cornell.In the Cornell Engineering information session, I recall the Director of Engineering Admissions reading the “values” of Cornell Engineering: “I love math and science! I love problem solving!” In countless college information sessions, I never heard anyone proudly say those words. For so many years, I was reluctant to say them myself, afraid of being tagged a nerd in the eyes of the future businessmen and businesswomen in my high school. Cornell students not only say these words, but live by them. ;When I read Cornell Engineering Spotlight on Students, I found Cornell Engineering student Mark Yatskar spent a year inventing new course scheduling software because what existed was unsatisfactory. He also participated in research of natural language processing, a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers “understand” the human world better. I believe I can comfortably work with such \"hardcore\" engineering students, who after suffering from the lack of solutions to problems share in the excitement of even small breakthroughs.It would also be great to do research on artificial intelligence with Professor Serge Belongie whose influential paper, Learning Localized Perceptual Similarity Metrics for Interactive Categorization, amazed me. The paper proposes an effective method for categorizing images which look quite similar to each other (differing significantly only in some local regions), but belong to the same big category. The method does not require experts to manually classify images to generate learning data, making it possible to get sufficient data from non-experts volunteers. The method solves almost all the theoretical problems of image classification. I’m inspired by the idea of the paper and wonder whether I can further my research with the similar approach to classification. Before reading that paper, I couldn't explicitly say why I wanted to study AI. Now I can: I want to break the limits of human intelligence by solving next-generation problems and in turn improve human's intelligence by the inspiration of artificial intelligence.My journey in artificial intelligence has only just begun and I hope my next steps in that journey are taken at Cornell."

    "CommonApp": "“Hello everyone, welcome to Computer Science. Before we start, let’s form groups of two. Every group should include a boy and a girl,” he explained. “Since few of you have knowledge in this subject and boys generally learn faster, I hope that boys can mentor girls.” I quickly found my partner and was eager to start, but a lingering feeling made me uncomfortable.Mr. Gao’s words led me to start observing the world around me more closely. At school, almost everyone assumes that “boys can do better than girls in science.” So whenever I received a high score on my physics test, I often received excessive amount of compliments as if I had accomplished an impossible mission. In addition, media and society in China like to make fun of female PhDs as if they couldn’t succeed in other areas in their life, so they had to settle on becoming intellectuals.After reading many articles on the Internet and books, I came to realize our society has used gender as a medium to carry out gender stereotypes unconsciously. Gender is no longer just an indication of sex. It is a set of unreasonable social standards that we blindly follow.It was then I realized how fortunate I had been growing up in an environment free of gender stereotypes. My parents always encouraged me to freely choose my interests and believed my abilities, whether it was in arts, sports, or studies.I love ballet, not because it is something that a girl is supposed to do, but because it has made me a stronger person. The bruise on my toes has endowed me the importance of fundamentals, and the bandages wrapped around my ankles to prevent repeating injuries always remind me the sweat and tear in practices. All the intensive trainings made each perfect split or a jeté off the ground more satisfying. Practicing ballet did not make me more “girly”, it made me more persistent and dedicated.On the other hand, I am a geek interested in computer science, which is against the mainstream thought. The tightly connected logics and extreme simplicity were fascinating to me. After spending a few hours with Java, I was able to create an app to help us memorize vocabularies better. Collaborating with my classmates, we improved the lunch ordering system with new functionalities within a social networking platform. Studying computer science has enabled me to think more critically and become more innovative. Utilizing lines of code in an artificial environment to solve real world problems, I am amazed by the potential of technology.These experiences have taught me that a person’s interests and potentials should not be restricted by gender. After all, we would not have an effective treatment for malaria if Dr. Tu Youyou chose not to pursue her passion in scientific research, a field that many consider more suitable for men. While I was lucky to explore my passions in a stereotype-free environment, I felt it was my responsibility to encourage those around me to pursue their interests despite the gender stereotypes. Whether it was encouraging a male classmate to continue his ballet dream despite pressure from his friends and family, or establishing an evening studying group for girls who are passionate about programming, I have tried, and will always try my best to challenge the gender stereotype so everyone around me can live up to their full potentials, regardless of their gender.",
    "Supps": "题目：Student self-governance, which encourages student investment and initiative, is a hallmark of the U.Va. culture. In her fourth year at U.Va., Laura Nelson was inspired to create Flash Seminars, one-time classes which facilitate high-energy discussion about thought-provoking topics outside of traditional coursework.

Today, even if females account for half of the workforce and have led some of the most preeminent companies, gender inequality is still an obvious issue.I want to host a Flash Seminar to discuss the true cause of unbalanced gender distribution in the STEM field because I disagree with the norm that since males are better at STEM than females, there are much more males than females in the field. Many capable women are discouraged to enter the field because they are thought to be inferior from the start. And because of this norm, women are less likely to receive the necessary assistance and resources to succeed in this field. This kind of environment is very unhealthy for females who are interested in STEM to grow and prosper.With the Flash seminar, I want to discuss with other U.Va. students about how to create a more encouraging environment for females to pursue and succeed in STEM field. I will also like to invite women who are very successful in their STEM field to share their experiences and offer advice to students who don’t want to be limited by this stereotype. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：College of Arts and Sciences - What work of art, music, science, mathematics, or literature has surprised, unsettled, or challenged you, and in what way? (250 words or half a page)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Shimoseka is a Japanese anime about government promoting ignorance to protect a dictatorship. The main character, Hyouka Fuwa, was a curious girl who was kicked out from the hospital because she asked too many questions about how babies were conceived. The story ended with Hyouka leading a revolution to overthrow the government in order to gain freedom to knowledge. ;The first time I watched Shimoseka, I laughed at the occasional comical scenes. However, as I rewatched it, I was able to understand it from a different angle. Watching the scene in which many sacrificed their lives to keep the revolution going, I was surprised by how far people were willing to go to be informed and to fight for the right to access knowledge. ;Owing to the invention of Internet, it seems that information and knowledge can be accessed anytime and anywhere nowadays. However, to some people and regions, the right to be informed is still considered a luxury. Hyouka was my inspiration to transform LIVE e-magazine into an informational platform for students to know and discuss issues in our school and society. While I might not be as brave as Hyouka to lead a revolution, I tried my best to bring the truth in front of our audience, whether it was about equal rights for homosexuality or a hidden construction project in school. After taking on the role of president of LIVE, I finally understood the importance of freedom to information shown in Shimoseka."

Although I didn’t quite understand the obscure psychoanalyses, the Freudian perspective that dream is caused by inner desire and is reflection of mind left me a deep impression. I found the theory fascinating because it not only explained why I sometimes dreamed of drawing or dancing, but it offered a bold and shrewd way to analyze people’s mind. It made sense to me.As I grew up, I started to read more about psychology and gradually tended to see the world through the lens of psychology. It helped me decode people’s behavioral patterns. For instance, once my club members deliberately procrastinated when they were going to fail their tasks. From learning about social psychology, I knew such behavior is called self-handicapping: people intentionally avoid applying efforts to keep potential failures from hurting self-esteem. As I was able to explain more and more social phenomena, I came to appreciate psychology – by interpreting people’s behaviors, emotions, and thoughts, it offered me a powerful tool to understand the human experience.Moreover, before I always felt upset about unfair social norms like gender inequality. But now, through analyzing the causes behind the social phenomena with psychology knowledge, I could apply psychology to solve social problems. For example, availability heuristic, a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to people, reinforces people’s biased thoughts in social stereotypes. Thus, by providing various perspectives on social issues like LGBT rights on LIVE and encouraging people to openly discuss, we partly restrained harmful stereotypical evaluations.In the future, to achieve my Magis in my life, I hope to ultimately become a psychologist to better analyze psychological processes in diverse social settings, and to devise more rigorous methodologies to find the best psychological solutions to address social problems."

    "CommonApp": "Growing up in a world where my parents are very open-minded and have never instilled gender stereotypical ideas in me, as a girl, I always thought gender inequality was an obsolete, past view of the ancient society. My parents always provided opportunities for me to explore my interests and inspired me to pursue what I truly wanted. I still remember they encouraged me to spend the whole weekends at the library to read; during school sports meetings, they would go to cheer for my games. Over the years, I have thus become an animation fan, a ballet dancer, an amateur painter, as well as an athlete.However, as I grew up, I realized the real world was very different from the world I came from. In my computer science class, Mr. Gao suggested each study group should include at least a boy because “For a difficult class like this, boys generally learn faster, so they can mentor girls.” He probably didn’t mean it but his words implied that girls couldn’t do as well as boys and thus needed help. “Am I really not as talented in computer science as boys?” I asked myself.Once during a shopping trip, I overheard a clerk saying, “My cousin’s daughter is getting her PhD soon but she hasn’t married yet. I will never let my daughter study for a PhD.” This conversation struck me. Isn’t PhD the symbol of intelligence? When has a girl getting a PhD become a bad thing? What if I want to pursue a PhD later?As those questions arose, I started to discover more about the real world I was entering. At school, almost everyone assumes that “boys can do better than girls in math,” despite that I am one of the best math students. “How does everyone know girls are not good at math if girls won’t even try?” Every time I went to the bookstore to look for books about photo and video editing software or programming, I was surprised by the fact that I was the only girl there, surrounded by boys. Even walking between the bookshelves, I felt uncomfortable. Every time I reached for a book about coding, I subconsciously began to worry that people around me would think of me as this weird girl who enjoys computer science. Many times, I hesitated and wondered, “Can I really be good at this?”Searching for answers over the Internet and reading many discussions, I came to understand the real world more clearly: While sex is given by nature, gender is defined by society. In many ways, our society has used gender as a medium to carry out stereotypes unconsciously. Gender is no longer just an indication of sex. It has imposed unreasonable social standards that we blindly follow.One night, I discussed my thoughts with my roommates. To my surprise, they thought that being seen as the weaker gender has a lot of advantages. They then listed various benefits of being a “female”, such as it is easier for a female to receive help and people usually expect less from girls. While I disagreed with them, I did not try to argue. I understand everyone needs help sometimes, but I just don’t want to be assumed that I need help because of my gender.That was when I realized how fortunate I was growing up in a “gender-less” world. I am a geek, as well as a fashion expert. I can “assemblé\" with “attitude” on a pair of ballet pointe shoes, and make a speech to run for the president of the Student Union.My world has influenced me to realize that no one should be given unequal treatment just because of gender, and from my various experiences in the real world afterwards, I have ultimately settled on my dream. I aspire to become a social equality activist in the future and my dream is to someday eventually eradicate the gender stereotypes and inequalities in the society.",

It was because of our articles about LGBT equal rights. Right after we published the articles, we were told that there was “inappropriate and disturbing content” in the magazine. LIVE was then suspended by our school officials indefinitely.Many of my classmates wondered why they did not receive the magazine on time before they learned about what had happened. In the past, as an editor, I was not aware that high school students were so eager to know about the sensitive issues in the society. Now, as president, I realized the changes we could bring to the campus. Despite the ban from our school, we determined to continue to operate LIVE through an online social media platform.Even if we need to sacrifice a lot of spare time and still face great pressure from some teachers sometimes, the amount of support we received from students and parents motivated us to keep publishing quality content and to encourage students to voice their opinions. As our popularity rose gradually, the school officials softened their tone. By creating such an open platform, we have created a more transparent school atmosphere for students.This experience is important to me because I have realized that freedom of speech is not just a natural right everyone should have, but also a luxury that we should persistently promote. I am proud of our LIVE community and will continue to make our campus a more liberal place to provoke thoughts and to advocate freedom of speech."

    "Supps": "题目：Beyond your impressive academic credentials and extracurricular accomplishments, what else makes you unique and colorful? We know nobody fits neatly into 500 words or less, but you can provide us with some suggestion of the type of person you are. Anything goes! Inspire us, impress us, or just make us laugh. Think of this optional opportunity as show and tell by proxy and with an attitude. \n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I’m always unsettled by titles like “female scientist,” or “female astronaut.” I don’t understand why the gender of an occupation has to be emphasized for females. Nonetheless, we never hear words like “male scientist,” or “male astronaut.” The last time I checked, neither English nor Chinese usage is gender specific. However, whenever we describe someone with a reputable profession, we often subconsciously assume they are male. It is ironic that an outstanding female professional has to be emphasized how rare she is.Strangely, when Tu Youyou won the Nobel Prize recently, I was yet again perplexed by the news headline “Congratulations to Tu Youyou as the first Chinese who wins the Nobel Prize in the field of science!” Where does the “female” go? In a field that is dominated by males, here is Professor Tu making a breakthrough in medical research as a female scientist. She is the living proof that females are just as good in STEM and could become an inspiration for girls who want to study STEM. However, the media purposely hide her gender from the public as if her gender were no longer important in this case.This is the paradox I am living with: on the one hand, I hope men and women should be treated equally. On the other hand, I hope the society not only recognizes but also emphasizes women’s achievements. As someone who wishes to eventually eliminate gender inequality, I also want to magnify this stereotype, so more are aware.For long, this has frustrated me. Should I refuse to use “female scientist” and fight against the masculine assumption in words like “scientist” and “astronaut?” Or should I use “female scientist” to emphasize the achievements accomplished by females in such fields? When will we achieve ultimate equality in the society?As I struggled to find an answer, I found a simple solution. According to Newton’s first law, if you want to change the motion of a subject, you have to apply a force first. When I started to learn ballet, I was asked to do “Relevé” as a warm-up every time before training. It was painful at first because our toes couldn’t withstand the weight of our entire body. However, this was just a basic practice that made our toes stronger so we could then perform all the complicated and delicate movements. By forcing myself to go through the “Relevé”, I was able to experience the joy of being a ballet dancer. Change, no matter big or small, is difficult. And the most difficult part is to get started.I have then realized the only way to solve my dilemma is to encourage and cultivate more and more female scientists, politicians, and business leaders, so no one will find it rare any more. Only when females in my generation are taking the initiates to break the stereotype, can we live in a perfectly gender-equal world. In the mean time, I will continue fighting and also appreciating the idea of “female scientist.”"

    "CommonApp": "“The witch poured some liquid into the princess’s mouth. She opened her eyes slowly and her pale face turned red.” “Mom, what is the liquid?” “A panacea, the strongest medicine, my boy.” “Does it exist?”“Only inside the fairy tale...Do not take it seriously. Have some sleep now.”  From that on, I started to entertain the dream of finding a panacea after having been hospitalized for two years due to thrombocytopenia. I cannot even remember when and how I learned about death, or the end, but I can still recall the nights I spent imagining the world without me. While lying on the bed, I often looked out of the window into the darkness and told myself “Perhaps I can invent a panacea”. Two years later, after exhausting all other options, I was miraculously cured by rhino horn powder. Since then, a white light appeared in the darkness.I became the most abnormal one among a group of ambitious kids who wants to change the world with wisdom and moxie. Whenever asked about ambitions, I was the one who sat most queitly at the corner of the stuffy classroom, waiting for others’ fingers being pointed at me, waiting for their laughters submerging my little dream.    Since panacea usually appeared as herbs in stories, I guess it might be hidden somewhere, maybe in the shrubs, or on a tree. I started to eat different types of plants I saw. “Min, take that out of your mouth!” my mom always shouted when she caught me stuffing flowers or leaves into my mouth. “Why do you want to study medicine, Min?” asked my dad. “I want to invent a panacea!”  “Childish! You are appearing as a boy who indulges in fairy tales” Tears started to roll down my cheeks. I was terrified. My fragile dream was being relentlessly stepped on, shattering into pieces. As I grew up and learned more about biochemistry, I came to realize how chimerical my dream was and found it increasingly difficult to persuade myself of the existence of such medicine. I underwent a dramatic psychological transition from a child to a teen, but still I could not resist thinking about a magical panacea and kept searching for any clue of its existence. It felt like stumbling in the darkness without a path to guide me, without a candle to enlighten the way, and even without a specific target to seek out. The only thing that existed in this void was a dim white light that appeared and vanished from time to time.    I began to read the latest news in medicine regularly. I learned about the groundbreaking progress in cancer treatment, how bio-medical engineering has made circulatory diseases more controllable, and how improvements in pill delivery can boost their efficiency in curing diseases like fever. However, whenever I looked up “panacea”, nothing ever came up because no adult would ever struggle with its existence. None. Gradually, I found myself aligning with those  “mature” people and started to search for papers written by graduate students of bio-medical engineering to learn what is “realistic”. “Min, have you decided your major?” Several months ago, my dad asked.“Bio-medical engineering, it pays well.” “It is good to have a dream when you are young.” “What dream? It is just a major” Feeling remorseful, I went back to my room. Browsing through the photos, in which I was covering my mouthful of plants with my hands, I asked myself, “Is the white light my ultimate destination anymore?” Or I am simply moving in the darkness, foolishly.  I looked at the white light in darkness, but I saw Armstrong stepping on the moon. I listened to a plane flying above, but I heard Wright Brothers being taunted. Let me make my own path, no matter where it leads to. Let me live in the fairy tale written by myself.",

After becoming attracted by the special school badge of Carnegie Mellon, which looks like a pineapple, I researched into the advantages of Carnegie Mellon over other colleges. Based on my research and close conversation with both my professor and other students at Carnegie Mellon, I have made up my mind to apply to Carnegie Institute of Technology and double major in biomedical engineering and chemical engineering. During my high school year, a large amount of time has been spent in conducting experiments in my school lab. In tenth grade, I participated in a chemistry lab club and we conducted a lot of interesting and simple experiments, including producing gold powder, blue crystal, small waterfall, bubbles of special shape, and making soda. I explored the knowledge behind these experiments and presented some of them to my classmates. These experiments largely established my early interest in lab chemistry. As I reached eleventh grade, I began to put efforts into more academic experiments that were related to medicine. As a high school student, many resources were unavailable to me and this was the first time that I felt my curiosity could not be satisfied at all. I encountered many problems, such as a lack of lab apparatus, chemicals, supervisor, and references, etc. All of these issues had to be solved by myself through saving money and looking for support from teachers and technicians outside of our school. Even a really simple experiment could take a month, and sometimes an entire day’s work could end up accomplishing nothing. Many people have asked me why I chose this path. Frankly, I have at least five versions of answers to questions as such, but it was not until recently that I realized that my stubbornness is probably what has been motivating me to look for reasons and persuade others and myself. It is a serious commitment to my childhood’s dream, which is to invent a panacea. ;After learning more about Carnegie Mellon’s engineering department, I realized that it is an opportunity that I cannot afford to lose. Carnegie Mellon has a really considerate and well-organized curriculum system that allows me to double major in chemical engineering and biomedical engineering without becoming overloaded. Also, I learned that undergraduates at Carnegie Mellon can have the opportunities to work with professors in research projects. This will not only solve all the problems I listed before, but also provide me with extra knowledge of what experts and doctors have been doing in this field. What I noticed in the introduction of biomedical engineering program is that there is one course called BME design, in which students with different majors in the Engineering department will be asked to do a project together. Having had similar experience before, I know how interesting and productive it is when people who are good at different subjects come together to do a project. Previously, I worked on an experiment related to low-density lipoprotein oxidation and collaborated with students who are good at physics to design a tract to simulate the blood vessel inside the human body. We did a demo in front of my schoolmates and the result was fantastic. One of the experiments that Professor Kathryn A. Whitehead at the Chemical Engineering Department is conducting is related to improving the efficiency of cancer markers through structurally altering the DNA molecule and letting them bind more strongly. Cancer treatment is an extremely important topic of medicine and I hope that I will have the opportunity to work with the professor to keep pace with the development of medicine industry.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：While not a requirement, have you been interviewed by an alumni or on campus representative prior to applying for admission? If so, indicate the name of your interviewer and tell us how it impacted your decision to apply.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          During this summer, I had a conversation with my chemistry professor Eric Henderson and PhD student, Gizelle Sherwood, about my future plan. I told them my about my childhood and talked about what I had done in order to move forward on this path. They asked me about what department at CMU and what other universities I am going to apply for and why I have made these choices. They were quite surprised at my decision to only apply for a short list of universities and my determination to set Carnegie Institute of Technology as my dream school. “ You do not have to be that focused while applying for a university because it would make you lose some opportunities.” “I heard that Carnegie Mellon is one of the most strict universities in the US and I am willing to take that challenge, since progress always stems from hard work. Also, the requirement for every student here to learn computer science also distinguishes Carnegie Mellon from other strong engineering schools.” This summer, I had a big picture of what students here at Carnegie Institute of Technology are doing and I found the rumor that life here is boring totally unwarranted. The robot snake shown by a student of the Engineering Department was amazing, and I could not believe how sophisticated it was when it crawled up the student’s arm. Last year when I studied at Berkeley for summer school, nothing of such kind was shown to me and it seemed that undergraduate life at Berkeley is going to be much more boring since I would not get the opportunity to spend much time in a lab when there are so many students. The PhD student Gizelle also made a brief introduction to the differences between the CIT and MCS and talked about the research and financial resources CIT has for students like me who want to have some research experience during undergraduate years. I think that CIT would offer more opportunities for students to collaborate since it is a really important skill that I have to improve on. Finally, Professor Whitehead and Gizelle asked me about my performances at school and my SAT/TOEFL scores. They both believed that CIT is a suitable school for me, which eventually eliminate my struggle between MCS and CIT to pick CIT as the department for my application."

    "CommonApp": "Growing up in China is very different from America. The most fundamental difference is that students in China are solely judged by academic achievement, so that it’s all about doing well on standardized tests. Both my brother and I went to the same school before I came to America. At the school, he was regarded as my shadow. “Why can’t you concentrate during class like your sister?” was probably the most popular comment my brother heard from teachers as he played with his Legos in class. It was easy to sympathize with my perception of him then, given how everyone else judged him. Even though I wasn’t the top student in my class, it was always reassuring to compare myself with him.One day, as my mom was driving me back from the airport for holiday break, we saw my brother cycling along the road on his fixed-gear bike, near the 50kph speed limit. I was astonished; I knew he loved sports but I never knew he was so...good at it.“Mom, his biking is too dangerous,” I said.“Well, there’s nothing I can do about that. I’ve given up after all these years. He can do whatever he wants to do,” she replied. There was nothing more to be said in the car, but I felt a strange sense of sadness combined with mischievous admiration.A few days later, my brother asked me to meet him at a cafe to chat. “What happened to your iPhone?” I asked. “It was much better than the one you have now.”“Well, I didn’t need its functions, and my school doesn’t let us bring phones anyways,” he answered.“So what happened to it?” I repeated.“I sold it. People are paying more than what they are worth nowadays. Plus, I needed the money to buy parts for my bike.”I knew my parents cut his allowance to discourage him from biking and distractions, so I continued, “Why do you waste your time instead of spending your time studying?”“You are just like the adults. You have no idea how much effort I put into biking.”I was beginning to feel indignant, but he wasn’t done. “Isn’t it the same for you though? You study math and science because mom and dad push you to. They also object your desire to study foreign languages in school. Aren’t you taking online language classes without them knowing? The only difference is that language is what you love and biking is what I love.”The little world inside me was silent for a moment.He is doing what he likes, but what about me? There was a time five years ago when I found my passion for French. But after two months of intensive courses, my parents didn’t consider them academic enough so the classes were cancelled. Eventually, I even gave up picking up words in my free time, or learning the language through film. There was simply no place for my unconventional passion. In America, I admired a Korean friend of mine who could speak five languages fluently. Often times, I wonder why that couldn’t be me, but now I understand it was because I didn’t have the bravery to step forward years ago. In front of my brother, I felt ashamed.After the exchange, I developed a new perspective of my brother, from someone good at nothing, to someone I secretly admired. He might be a failure to the world, but he has something he is really driven to pursue in spite of pressure from our parents and teachers. My entire perspective changed when I realized that what defines “success” is based on popular opinion that does not always celebrate a person’s individual interest. I now recognize that not knowing oneself is the biggest evil of all, and that it is important to value our natural passions before we end up drifting nowhere.",

Living in both Shenzhen and Hong Kong, the ripples of the fast pace and efficient city lifestyle had a huge impact on me. The convenience of travel, easy access to resources, constant exposure to the latest technology and trends, along with the go-getter’s mentality that everybody possessed helped shape my own productive habits and behavior. City life is where I feel the most comfortable.Another aspect of city life that I love so much is the diversity. Just like when I first came to America, exposing myself to the culture and different ideas pushed me outside of my comfort zone. My educational and cultural upbringing in China trained me to become a “soldier” that only knew how to follow directions and disregard my own opinions. Through interactions with my American friends and classmates, where everyone grew up in different environments, I found there are a lot of life lessons I have yet to learn. Most importantly I gained the desire to keep exploring the world to find the environment and lifestyle that fits me best. Diversity had played a big role in shaping my personal growth. This is why New York is the ideal environment for me; the city is vibrant, fast paced, trend setting, and filled with all sorts of people. Just by living in New York is already a unique learning experience, while the NYU campus will allow me to experience diversity without stepping outside of the campus.At NYU I want to study economics. My interest for this subject developed from being a frequent shopper who pays detail attention to prices and my own sporadic shopping behavior. Most importantly I want to study economics because of the aspect of human interactions and understanding social trends. I believe the well-rounded curriculum in the Department of Economics will provide me with a strong background in economic theory and help me become a more educated decision maker and consumer.Through NYU’s research centers and institutes such as the Center for Global Economy and Business, and C.V. Starr Center for Applied Economics I hope to gain academic enrichment outside of the classroom. I want to do research and delve deeper into issues that I often observe in life such as wealth distribution and the affects of social psychology on the economy.Within the economics club and finance society I hope to visit big companies and institutions around New York, listen to lectures from top executives of Fortune 500 companies, and build my network. Most importantly, there are substantial help in finding jobs or internship through the career development department. Furthermore, through the global career resources there are many learning opportunities through internships in different countries. Personally, my first choice would be Tokyo, Japan. Studying there will allow me to improve my intermediate level Japanese in addition to learning more about the culture and its relationship to their economy."

    "CommonApp": "Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an unforgettable place. There is an entire community that dedicates their life to chanting piously in the Jokhang Temple, and where kids my age already live as shepherds, tending their flock along the Mongolian steppe. Born and raised on that boundless prairie, one shepherd told me that the grassland was his whole world.At that time, I could not understand how they could tolerate the trivial and purposeless lifestyle. I was even shocked when several told me they were happy. Shouldn’t we all have a desire and responsibility to make our lives rich and full, like scientists who continually contribute improvements to human society? Surely scientists must feel happier than an office worker or farmer.In fact, with a deep interest in scientific reading, I was convinced that being a scientist would maximize meaning in my life. This was why I chose to spend two weeks at Qingdao University, working in a biochemistry program with many graduate students to further my scientific dreams. My mind immediately filled with images of great scientists: Albert Einstein, and Bhor. I imagined myself at the Fifth Solvay conference, as a respectable scientist debating the future of science.Things, however, did not start well. It was not until I arrived that I realized the university was based in outdated Chinese-styled buildings, which I had ignored the first time I passed by.The following week in the lab was no better. In two weeks time we failed experiments one after another because of tiny mistakes such as unnoticed residue reactants. Even when we succeeded, the result of our painstaking efforts was nothing significant, concluding with a set of data shown as an abstract chromatogram. During my first encounter with the control variate method, I also learned that the significant discoveries of Penicillin or DNA were results of mere persistence and luck.It was during the experience that I realized the life of science was just another kind of life, not any more amazing than ‘normal’ jobs like office work or shepherding. Too many scientists, I learned from the leading professor, would spend their life never discovering anything significant. That was when I felt greatly depressed, heavily discouraged in my pursuit of a meaningful life.Recalling the faces on the highlands, I wondered – who lived better lives? Whose life is more desirous? I realized that these questions can never be answered fairly. I may see huge possibilities from prestigious careers, but on the shepherds’ thin faces I could see serenity that could hardly be found in the city. It seemed to be a paradox, but the truth is that they simply enjoyed the life they chose.As my original expectations faded, I too felt enjoyment from my work. Time after time I was attracted by the images in transmission electron microscopy or the complex but beautiful structures of hydrogen hexachloroplatinate hexahyrate. The sense of fulfillment I felt was strong, even though life as a scientist no longer seemed as impressive.My experiences in Qingdao, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia showed me that all lives contain meaning and joy, which can be overlooked when using achievement as a standard. Such an understanding endowed me with a new viewpoint: As I again walk through the streets observing people, I see young woman leaving work trying hard to get on a packed bus. I also see an old worker carrying his family on a bike talking with his daughter. This time however, there is no judgment but only a respect for the lives they have chosen.Also, for a long time, my pursuit of achievement prevented me from exploring the lives around me, but as they become more colorful through my new attitude, I have a newfound curiosity for different ideas. Through my own involvement, I want to see and learn more from others, exploring the wealth of fulfillment people can find in their lives.",

With one can of each cola in my hands, sipping from both at the same time, the result of my research is the realization that there are limits to our tasting ability. For the toothpastes, well, it is probably not a good standard to judge them by their taste, but Colgate suits foam-lovers like me, who would like to spend time in bathroom foaming from our mouth. Some of these things seem to be frivolous, but to me they are the small fulfillment of my curiosities.When I firstly encountered relativity and its theories of light and time, I could not calm down from the excitement brought on by a totally new understanding of our universe. We all dream about traveling through time like the famous character Doraemon, hoping to see images of our past from our own eyes. However, it does happen, not in imagination, but in everyday life. Looking up into the night sky, the star you see is what it used to appear millions or billions of years ago. We can see the past! I poured all my thoughts to my friend, with great passion and anticipation for his shared excitement. Unfortunately, I still remember the confusion on his face during my outburst. It seemed they needed a reminder that they were no longer in a cryptic calculus or physics class.Eventually, my friends started to call me “little prince of science” (please don’t ask why) instead of my name, which brought much embarrassment in front of teachers or other classmates. I tried to avoid attention by acting more normal in class, but it was not an easy task at all. Many times in class I was so excited that I shouted out whenever my teacher mentioned familiar terms like “event horizon” or “Kerr black hole”. Every time I would quickly regret it because it soon becomes a good topic for my friends to joke about.No matter if it is curiosity in science and music, curiosity in taking unique photographs, or curiosity in the difference between Pepsi-cola and Coca-cola, curiosity is a part of my life that I cannot live without. It is like spark igniting my desire to learn from the world around me, so much that my life seems defined by my curiosity, filled with moments of enlightenment and embarrassment. It is curiosity that brings me colorful experiences, and that makes my life. Having courage to explore their own differences is the way colorful people live, and is also the way I want to live."

    "CommonApp": "It wouldn’t feel natural at home without the endless variations of, “Jeffrey, go finish your homework now!” Sometimes I would think it was my mum’s pet phrase, beginning from primary school; it seems procrastination starts early.Some days, I may close myself in my room and open “Records of the Three Kingdoms”, casting myself into the exciting battles or brilliant stratagem. Other days, it may be Behrman moving me with profound love in O. Henry’s “Last Leaf”. Meanwhile my composition (or whatever unlucky assignment) due the next day would sit neglected on my desk. I may tell myself banteringly, “Certainly, I will finish them later. There are just better things to do now!”I may simply be the “King of Procrastination”, but to me, “procrastination” should be redefined as “to be consumed by things I love.” I procrastinate not because tasks are too onerous, but because I cannot forsake the things I am enthusiastic for.During dinner, my focus is seldom on the dishes. When I was eight, after my first of many acupuncture treatments, I asked, “Dad, how can acupuncture cure my disease?” My dad, a public health physician, explained Chinese medical theories of pressure points and our body’s flow of energy. Other dinners began with, “Dad, why does blood coagulate when blood groups are different?” or even silly ones like, “Dad, will it be okay to insert ‘good’ genes into a sick body?” It seems often that before the soup is even touched, a discussion is raised from my curiosity, prolonging dinner with food barely eaten.I still remember the time I practiced “Schindler's List” on the violin during junior high. It was such beautiful music that I decided to practice until I was perfect, even though there was no performance to give. It seemed I was a little bit “out of line”, because instead of studying for a final exam, I practiced everyday during what was my “study time”.Was it a good decision to sacrifice studying? It is true that I did regret not doing excellent on that exam, but thinking back, the benefit of acing the exam would have been short-lived, compared with a mastered performance that will never be forgotten, and available at the lift of my bow. For that, each practice begets no regrets. For that, I procrastinate.I was also able to develop my unusual interest in history with my endless reading. It became recreational to share history topics with others while eating or waiting in lines, allowing me to befriend those who were curious about Ying Zheng’s feats, or the development of first modes of production in China.Similarly, the prolonged dinner conversations have influenced my life more than any lesson I have learned in school. The discussions started off childish, but thanks to my parent’s patience, I gained confidence to share my opinions and ask questions. I became analytical, and learned how to build assumptions and reason on my own. If I didn’t insist on having such talks at the dining table, I would have never formed my interest in biomedical science through my dad’s inspiring knowledge.I used to hesitate about my so-called dilatoriness because others disapprove it, but when I see myself today, I am more proud of what I accomplished in spite of my responsibilities, than of what I was required to do. This is just who I am, The King of Procrastination, and dictator of my own life.",

How have you personally disproved this generalization?

Walking into the acupuncture ward for the first time, I was shocked by the loud and heart-wrenching crying of dozens of kids with needles on their heads, arms, and legs, struggling awkwardly with tears covering their faces and saliva dripping from their distorted faces.Unfortunately, people who passed by the acupuncture ward commonly looked with revulsion on their faces. It can even be common to hear, “Cerebral palsy? Must be terrible to be brain damaged and retarded.” Outside of the ward, sometimes the two words were used to insult people. It seems with the disabled, we are not even tolerant or understanding.But it appeared I was “destined” to get along with these children during my three years of muscle spasm treatments. Most times, verbal communication was meaningless, but I still tried to talk with them during the long hours, sometimes even using hand gestures. I watched movies and TV shows with them, like the launch of Chang'e I on television, and went for walk together in the corridor (though they really walked slowly with unsteady steps). I was even able to see a six-year-old girl, Dongqing, return to normal life in society after 4 years of treatment. The experience affected me a lot, showing me that behind their disability or disease, they were the same as us.I think it was wonderful that I interacted with those “special children”, because they not only taught me more about cerebral palsy, but also showed me it is possible that we young people are quite similar, and can form close bonds with each other no matter our differences.

For me, this addiction bothered me from grade five to eight. It was common then to find me stuck in front of the computer screen, especially during holidays. I was lucky that it didn’t disadvantage me in my study, but I certainly could’ve done much better.More recently, I learned that Internet addiction is such an insidious problem that it can become a great problem to society. Out of curiosity, I conducted research last year—a big survey among 10 middle schools—to gather average time students spend on the Internet, and what they do. I then used statistical software to analyze the data and combined the conclusion with news articles to create a presentation for my classmates during a class meeting, to create more awareness for Internet addiction, and maybe through warning, help people overcome it.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：According to author Walker Percy, “At regular intervals, poetry students should find dogfish on their desks and biology students should find Shakespeare sonnets in their dissecting trays.” Explain why you agree or disagree.

It was always the case in primary school, after returning home, to quickly rush into my room, engrossing myself in history. I will never forget the “Records of the Three Kingdoms”, composed of over 900,000 characters that I read across two years. Meanwhile “General History of China” introduced me to the origins of Chinese civilization, beginning from remote antiquity.I love history because I can see the implications in daily life, learning how the food we eat and the traditions we uphold are influenced by certain events. Moreover, I found myself more social and interesting as I made friends through those curious about Ying Zheng’s feats, the colorful life of the Song Dynasty, or the development of first modes of production in China. Even as a biology lover, I can’t imagine how life would be without history.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \"If I know your sect, I anticipate your argument.\" Describe a time when your argument challenged a basic belief or viewpoint of your \"sect.\" (150 words or fewer)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I took part in a city wide competition of Rude Goldberg machine when I was in junior two, spending a month to plan and build a sophisticated contraption using simple and crude components (including Legos and planks) to lift a team flag. In the end, we earned second place.However, unlike most other competitors, I didn’t care for it. I could never understand the purpose behind accomplishing simple goals using over-complicated methods. In fact, I joined hoping to discover some profoundness to the objective, but left with even less enthusiasm.I follow a simple rule in life, and that is to remain simple. I think the beauty of progress lies in solving complicated problems with simple solutions, rather than the opposite. This is how I plan to approach biology in college, with a goal to finding more efficient solutions to the challenges in biomedical science. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：List five books (with authors) that piqued your curiosity.

Though his theories might have flaws, the are really novel and “predictive”, for example, believing that genes were a type of aperiodic crystal, and that mutation in biology can be explained by the Quantum Transition theory in physics.His analogies made unprecedented connection between biology and physics, which lead the field of biology to a brand new direction. Through him, I learnt that biology is not simply animal science, but was related to many different subjects and could be studied in different ways, inspiring me with the limitless potentials.Of course, it is also important that this book is not so serious, “relaxing” enough so we don’t need to sit beside the desk with pens and papers when discussing its brilliance. Last but not least, the many challenging hypotheses in the book can be an enjoyable challenge for me to “convert” my fellow roommates into the subject."

    "CommonApp": "Achoo!In kindergarten, I carried my handkerchief everywhere to cover my nose when I sneezed. It hung on the balcony, flapping in the night while I slept, which was the only time I could breathe freely without being interrupted.It may be ridiculous to imagine how sneezing can trouble one’s life that much, but because of my chronic rhinitis, since I could remember, every day was filled with crazy sneezing, while teachers and classmates talked from a distance. I couldn’t concentrate during classes because of intermittent sneezing and couldn’t act lively as other students because sneezing had tired me so much. By the end of each day, my nose was so sore that I wanted to cut it off.But all these physical discomforts were nothing compared to embarrassing myself before everyone, including those I liked and those who waited to see me make a spectacle of myself. I became so diffident that I could only bury my head in my desk and sniffle feebly all day.Eager to change the situation, I started with folk prescription. I stored a bottle of water in the freezer every night and poured it onto my face the next morning with enormous hope. Water always turned to ice and completely numbed my face, especially during the freezing winter. It was like the Ice Bucket Challenge except that I repeated the same challenge over and over again. I also tried another traditional idea – jogging. Dragging my legs and running alone in the dark, I felt my loneliness most keenly. Nights became longer and the weather got colder, but I still did not stop sneezing during the day.Over the years, I have used dozens of handkerchiefs and thousands of tissues. I have tried countless methods to cure my rhinitis, but gradually after endless failures, I discovered that the more I tried to avoid the disease, the more unsettled and alienated I felt. My behavior and reactions towards it created a new problem. I needed to face it, accept it, and embrace it. I could not change my condition, but I could change my attitude towards it.I slowly built confidence from the frustration I had accumulated. I was afraid that no one would like someone whose special talent is constant sneezing, but I began to focus on myself and live my life without caring what other people saw me. I began to break out of my introvert walls. Instead of avoiding strange looks, I actively began talking to people and formed many friendships. My parents actually went from worrying about me being too introverted, to now worrying that I’m too extroverted. Additionally, the purpose of exercise was to cure my rhinitis, but now hiking has developed into my favorite hobby. This is perhaps the meaning of living life with defect. Defects are not problems necessary for people to eliminate in pursuit of a normal life, but reasons for people like me to live differently. Sneezing spurred me to adjust to my environment differently, and while I may never experience a ‘normal’ life, I believe my own way of life is equally worth living.I am on the mend as I grow older, sneezing less as time goes by, but I always keep several packs of tissues with me wherever I go. They not only ease my mind, but also remind me of those old days that I fought as a helpless child, who I no longer am.",

In high school, forced by the education system to study 9 subjects simultaneously, I was frustrated when I had to spend time studying subjects I was uninterested in. Meanwhile, all my knowledge in history, such as the expansion of Christianity or the formation of England, had to be learned from museums and books. At Rochester, I hope to fully enjoy the flexibility of the open curriculum to gain comprehensive training in history and humanity courses.I am always obsessed with the Medieval Ages, the mysterious and fascinating period that connects the past with the prosperous modern Europe. While the majority holds an extremely negative view towards this, they have ignored the boom of religions and politics during that time. At Rochester, I hope to understand more about that period through courses like Medieval Europe or The Third World, and from rare resources at Robbins Library for medieval studies, to develop an all-round and objective viewpoint.Besides, through the opportunities offered by Public History Internship Program at Rochester, I hope to teach history to a broader audience by giving tours on Erie Canal boat or decoding ancient letters for museums, because I believe history can make people better critical thinkers.My whole heart is beating with yours, Rochester.

    "CommonApp": "When I was in middle school, my grandmother imparted the advice that “The greatest blessing of life is about not leaving a single regret, never having to feel the remorse of ‘ah, what if’”. So from that day, I began starting my journal entries with, “Is there anything that you would regret in these past 24 hours?”Sadly, I often stopped short of finishing the word “no”, forced to begrudgingly scribble “yes.”‘What if’ I’d ran another lap during practice? ‘What if’ I’d reviewed a little more before the quiz? I could have gotten a perfect score.I noticed that, no matter how hard I tried, within that limited 24 hours, there was always something sacrificed. With each opportunity taken (big or small), another was lost, leaving me wondering if I had made the right decision and regretting what might have been. Stuck in this cursed paradox of opportunity cost, I could feel the growing burden of “what if’s”. So eventually, I stopped writing down the question entirely. I had let my grandmother down. Maybe we are just two types of people, she being gifted and wise and I being… just the opposite. It was a long time until I started journaling again. Time away had given me time to reevaluate my definition of ‘regretlessness’. As I stared at my journal, a similar question appeared, but in a different form:“Are you satisfied with your decision to study aboard?” Dated Dec 25. 2012, the entry came as I was grappling with the biggest decision I had to make in life thus far: giving up my school career in China, leaving home for a radically unfamiliar life, and dealing with the grueling process of US high school applications. I thought about my grandmother’s words, and surprisingly, for the first time I wrote the answer that I long desired.“Yes, I’m satisfied.” Could my life be better if I had decided to stay in China instead of studying aboard? Maybe. There were definitely things being sacrificed: all of my friends, my family, potential opportunities in China and the comforts of living in a culture that I was familiar with. Yet in that moment there was one thing that I was 100% sure of: I was satisfied because I knew that the opportunity I was choosing would help me most to grow, allowing me to become a person who was independent, mature, and worldly.I still remember that, after making my decision, I sat on my bed and stared at the four maps hanging on my bedroom wall. The maps ranged from a city map to a map of the world. Since a young age, I had always wanted to see the world and break away from my current environment, a place that I found limiting and stifled. Here was my chance. Yes, choosing to study abroad meant foregoing other opportunities, but I found peace in that idea that only by choosing to study abroad could I really take the first steps down the path of realizing my goal to see what the world looks like and what opportunities exist in it.I felt I had finally found the key behind grandma’s smile. Living regretlessly isn’t about taking every opportunity put in front of me. It is about whole-heartedly pursuing the opportunities that will best help me achieve the personal growth that I desire. Study abroad was one such opportunity. Therefore, no looking back; no regrets.Since then, everyday, instead of journaling, I look into the mirror, think about who I am now and who I wish to become, and set small goals to achieve these changes.Everyday before bed, I return to the mirror and ask “have you accomplished your goals? Have you taken another step beyond your limits?” Through this active pursuit of self-fulfillment, more and more often I’m finding I can proudly tell myself: Mike, today, has no regrets.",

When asked why she participated, a smiling undergraduate immediately replied, “It helps me connect with the community.” ;In high school, my Saturday mornings consisted of waking up at 5:30am and feeding the homeless breakfast through a program called Clay Street Table. My weekday evenings were filled with planning school events in Student Council. Through this, I learned that school should be more than just classes: it is about interaction, exchange, and service. ;I see this same spirit of service and social action in Wake Forest. Advertising itself as “a place where serving humanity…is expressed in every endeavor,” I believe Wake Forest’s strong social sciences programs and demonstrated commitment to service make is a place where I can better both myself and my community. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe an academic or intellectual project, experience or pursuit of which you are particularly proud.

However, winning student council elections is not easy, especially for students living in the dormitory, which day students refer to as \"The Island\". Most “dormies” are international students, and amid the language barrier and dealing with cultural differences, there definitely existed a gap between us.Thus, for my student-council platform, I proposed a dorm/day student exchange program. The activity tasked dormies to stay in the home of a day student for a few days to promote dialogue and exchange. Parents and administrators were receptive, and through the success of this program, I won a coveted student council spot.After joining Stu-co, I have continued to coordinate more activities that encourage participation from both the island and the “mainland.” Through them, I believe we are slowly eliminating gaps and building a more unified community."

    "CommonApp": "I know a young man with naturally dark-blue hair and deep, indigo eyes. He travels all over the planet, learning customs from bizarre tribes and listening to fascinating stories from other experienced travelers. When he isn’t traveling, he lives with his cartoonist roommate. At night, the two take long walks together in picturesque parks, or have fine dinners at cheap restaurants. Meanwhile, the traveler tells his roommate the stories from his adventures, stories that teach his roommate that the world is so big that to not explore its beauty would be to leave life incomplete. I am there during their little chats, but only as an observer. You see, I do not live in their world. I started writing stories about my blue-haired companion and his fantastical adventures a few years ago. His fictional world has become a place where I go to escape reality for a while. It is a place that contains a certain magic that my life lacks. Now after nine chapters and nearly 160,000 words, my heroic traveler and his cartoonist roommate have grown to be more than just fiction. I see myself in the cartoonist: he’s shy but imaginative, diligent yet diffident. Meanwhile the traveler is a free spirit. He is responsible and loyal, curious and logical, brave and compassionate; he has all of the qualities that I look up to.While parts of my characters are definitely reflections of my world, perhaps the more important aspect of my story writing is how I have become a reflection of theirs. Whenever I have troubles in life, I often find myself thinking: what would the characters in my stories do? When I face big challenges, I think of my character’s strong belief in hope, and that makes me feel less desperate; when I make a mistake, I recall my character’s willingness to take responsibility for their mistakes, and it gives me courage to take responsibility for mine as well. Over time, this relationship with my characters has become a formula for my behavior; together with them I’ve been able to craft a moral blueprint, applying the lessons I have derived to my real-life actionsThrough this process, my blue-haired traveler and I have helped mold each other. For him, I’ve built a fictional world filled with opportunities to see mystical places and magical events. In return, he’s given me a chance to see life through a new lens and heighten my perceptiveness. Writing his story has taught me to look for the inspiring, respectable aspects of human nature out of a dull and sometimes harsh reality. He’s reminded me that ‘the world is so big that to not explore its beauty would be to leave life incomplete.’In my stories, certain characters have the ability to create magical wonders out of nothing. I like to think writing my stories has given me this ability as well, helping me recognize the once seemingly insignificant affections that I had been ignoring. It has made me appreciate those around me more, whether it be the friend who brought me breakfast on his way to school or my teachers who tirelessly work to ensure that I understand my coursework. In this way, I have learned that magic is simply that necessary spark needed when everyday life becomes such that I stop looking for its beauty and forget to cherish its good. These newfound senses of insight and gratitude have become my “magic”, brightening and enhancing my life.I am grateful to my blue-haired traveler. With every epic adventure, I am able to see his world from a different angle. With every story, his fiction makes my reality just a bit more magical.",

Please feel free to address your first- and second-choice major selections (250 word limit).\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Many of my relatives have asked me why I decided to study genetics at sixteen, comparatively early for my age. There are complex reasons, with the politely convincing ones being that genetics allows us to see into and even affect the future. At least my relatives buy that answer. Once in a while though, someone will pry for more. My answer to these curious inquirers is that nothing beats the thrill of exploring the codes of life and paving the path for new technologies that could potentially give human life a makeover. ;As nerdy as this reason may sound, my passion for genetics burns like a flame, and at USC, I am sure to encounter the “bonfire” that can fuel my passion even further.Going through USC’s website, I was amazed by the depth of biology major. The department is highly diversified, with a broad range of intriguing concentrations, like “Human Evolutionary Biology”, and electives, like “Origins and Evolution of Human Behavior”. This great variety of opportunities within the major is a treasure trove for a biology nerd like me. Given the complexity of any one particular biological problem, this diversity of courses is what I really need, as I am aware that any one biological problem involves many biological branches and that to master this subject requires an interdisciplinary network of knowledge. ;Ultimately, utilizing USC’s abundant resources, I will receive a comprehensive biology education, that will bring me one step closer to my dream of becoming a professional researcher.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：USC students are known to be involved. Briefly describe a non-academic pursuit (such as service to community or family, a club or sport, or work, etc.,) that best illustrates who you are, and why it is important to you. (250 word limit) \n                                  \n                                      \n                                          “You, and you, and you: You’ve got to give them hope.”These were Harvey Milk’s final words in the film “Milk.” Sitting in silence as the credits rolled, I did not know whether “they” had received this hope since the year Milk was assassinated. But at that moment, I had a sudden feeling that I would like to be one of the “you”s Milk was referring to. ;The movie “Milk” was my first formal introduction to the LGBT community. The inspiration that I felt watching it led to me to join HomoSociety, a school club dedicated to raising awareness for sexual minorities on our campus and in our community.Through HomoSociety, I became much more aware of the prejudice that sexual minorities face. I found this bigotry completely inconsistent with the moral values I’d grew up learning: that everyone is born equal, and that we should all show love and respect towards one another. Thus, I decided to make my small contribution to the fight for equality. Since joining HomoSociety, I have given presentations on the basic biology and politics of sexual orientation, written questionnaires to investigate students’ attitudes towards sexual minorities, and led trips to local LGBT activism organizations.Gradually, HomoSociety has become an important part of my life. Every meeting reminds me of the deeply rooted inequality in society and how much the world still needs to be changed. Big progress has been made in recent years, however, and I feel proud to be involved."

    "CommonApp": "“Don’t you know that it is very dangerous to play in that area?” my mom asked me.“I know! But that was what the director asked me to do!” I said. “And who contributed to my losing the competition.” I thought.In elementary school, I attended a TV show where many young kids gathered in competition. The TV show’s host wanted to evaluate how the kids would react to different situations with the highest total score after a week deciding the winner. I am the kind of person who always wants to win.One day during the competition, we were sent to a swimming pool with separated shallow and deep water areas. At first, all of the kids played in the shallow water. After a while, the director came to me and asked me to pretend to play in the deep water. I was a docile kid who would follow whatever my parents or teachers asked me to do because I believed they were always right. Without surprise, I agreed. In the following days, the director always asked me to “perform” and I did so. In the last day, I was shocked when I got my low score. I always did what I thought was right and I followed what the director asked me to do. There was no reason for me to get such a low score! Not until the day when my mother questioned me did I realize the reason: maybe I should not follow whatever authority told me to do.Why did I do that? I started my introspection. Because authority often gives deliberate opinions based on experience and are often tested to be useful. As a child, I am too callow to make circumspect decision so that I prefer to respect and adhere to elder’s opinions. However, the reason why I got hurt is because it does not mean that the ideas of authority must be the ones I choose to follow though I respect them. Their ideas are based on their own experience, their own advantage and depend on other very personal facts that are not the same for everyone, so they cannot work on everyone. I should refer and consider their thoughts and adjust them to face my condition and my personality to make the final decision. In conclusion, I should think critically when making decision rather than automatically follow the order of authority.Before my 11th grade year, I needed to decide whether to prepare for studying abroad in the USA or keep learning traditional Chinese education courses and go to a Chinese University. “My advice is for you to continue your study in China. You will have to improve your English significantly to achieve the American college standard but you can get into a good school easily with your current Chinese grades, which will give you a happier future.” my teacher told me. But is that really a happy future or a boring and predictable future for ME? I like challenging myself and to be conventional will just make life less colorful. Finally, I decided to enter the school’s AP course program. Now a year after my making the big decision, it is unbelievable and happy to find out that my vocabulary and reading speed has been improved greatly. Having more freedom to choose the class I like and do activities I want, I feel like I am living for myself instead of complete the process of being a traditional “successful” person.Critical thinking makes people different from each other, and this difference pushes society forward. My individual thoughts made realize my value as an intellectual person instead of an instrument. I am glad that I made the best choice that time to enter that AP course program and I would definitely make the same decision again.",

Though recondite for me to understand, I still feel the magic charm of science. In Grade 10, I was enrolled into physics competition class with the fourth highest score. Then in the learning process, I felt the beauty of conciseness that is presented by science. Finding the order and rule through apparently chaos is the magic of science. Solving a math problem after a long time and disputing the best way to solve a problem can just satisfy my sense of achievement. What is more, science can never be completed. There are always flaws in the former principles and can be corrected later. I enjoy the process of exploring and pondering.Considering my preference of science, I am fond of Physics most, knowing that it studies not only the nature rules, but to understand the behavior of matter and energy on every level, from the origins of the universe in the Big Bang to the interior of atoms in our computer screen. As a student who likes to take challenges and with strong high school physics background, I’m eager to take the Honors physics sequence, Physics 160/260, for gaining a thoroughly modern approach to both mechanics and electricity and magnetism. Moreover, I am desired to join the Undergraduate Opportunity Research Program, where I would create close partnerships with Michigan researchers and share a wealth of interesting research topics. What perks me up is the Women in Science and Engineering Program. I am excited to communicate with like-minded girls from diverse fields, such as science, technology, engineering and math. I enjoy the collision of inspiration. In WISE, being a wise lady!While a career in the physics is my current goal, I still enjoy other disciplines and want to explore new ones under the guidance of LSA. Communicating with alumna of my high school who had been enrolled in UM, I know that the atmosphere at UM is accepting anything I want to try, even outside my major. If I am able to be admitted, UM would definitely be a place where I could thrive both as a student and especially a scholar. ;Recently when I focus myself on UM news, I am thrilled to find that undergraduate researchers in UM discover new trans-neptunian objects. Being a physics enthusiast, I can’t wait to be a part of such a rigorous and vibrant community, seeking a pure understanding of how the world works and revolutionized our lives.

It was my first time to pave roads and build houses from every brick and stone. During the process, I enjoyed watching the new houses locating in front of us with our own efforts. I enjoyed hearing the salutation from smiling children who only knew “hello” in English. I want to involve myself in such activities in the future and appeal to more people for caring child survival and development in poverty-stricken area."

    "CommonApp": "On Becoming a Hero“Always remember that rescuing does not mean to sacrifice your life to save another’s. The simplest but most important principle is to save yourself before saving others. Never try to be a hero.” This was the first and the last thing my coach emphasized at each rescue course. However, I was too eager and excited to understand what it really meant because I was already fantasizing about being a hero. Months before the course, I told almost everyone that I would soon become a rescuer, just to enjoy their admiration. “Wow! So you are going to save someone from dying. Does that mean you are going to be a hero?” Saying nothing, I just smiled and walked away, imagining the day I would swoop someone out of water in a Spiderman-like fashion. “Yes, I will be a hero.” I thought.Training was punishing, but the fantasy of being a hero helped me get through it. Two days before the certificate test, coach took me out for one last practice. “Accident!” My fellow diver shouted when I was putting on my gears. Coming to the edge of the ship, I saw someone floating in the water, not moving. Already thought of myself as a rescuer, the only thing on my mind was to save him. So I jumped into the water and immediately I realized I had made a mistake: not wearing goggles. I gritted my teeth and could hardly open my eyes. Instead of keeping calm and run through a mental checklist, there was no logic or reasoning running through my head. I had only one single thought, “I am a rescuer, I must drag him onto the ship.”When I got to him, I found out it was my partner. However, coach was nowhere to be found, he must have already dove too deep to notice us. A paralyzing thought overwhelmed me,“Can I make it back to the boat alive?” I was shocked and froze for a few seconds before the water that rushed into my throat pulled me back to reality. “Thank god he is still breathing!” Coughing and spitting ceaselessly, I started dragging him back, while the waves punched my face constantly. Finally reaching the boat, I used my very last breath shouting: LIFESAVING RING! Being pulled back onto the boat was the last thing I could remember before I passed out from exhaustion.When I opened my eyes, three guys were staring at me on the beach. All of a sudden I realized what was going on, a “test”. Looking at them, I started to giggle, for my childishness and impulse: I was so naïve to think that my coach and another skillful diver would get into trouble so easily. “I was not far behind you in the water watching your performance. You did make a lot of silly mistakes but not too bad for a freshman. Congratulations, rescuer.” Coach smiled, and I could only smile back (But I really just wanted to say #$%! you).Lying on the boat, recalling everything that has just happened, it was so different from my imagination of my own heroic story. Trying to be a hero without mental preparation and absolute confidence in my abilities, I could have actually become the person I was trying to rescue. I used to believe that the most important qualities heroes must possess are bravery and the impulse to help those in need, which give rise to heroes in any given situation. However, being a hero requires much more than courage and instincts. A true hero is someone calm, wise and helps others on a constant basis. A true hero could not be fabricated. This experience was an important benchmark on my journey to becoming a hero and it probably will not be my last fiasco. It seems I still have a long way to go.",

My parents, who are both engineers made the mistake of showing me how to use tools at the young age of 6. I dismantled whatever I could get my hands on around the house. It wasn’t long until my tools were confiscated. My curiosity has guided me to the world of cars. This past summer I successfully begged my father to let me intern at his friend’s car repair shop, where I was able to get a head start in this field. In college, I want to study Mechanical Engineering, in order to gain the knowledge and skills I need to do innovative car designs. ;In USC, I will have the opportunity to receive an excellent education on machineries through the AME Department of the Viterbi School of Engineering. Class AME 453 will help me gain knowledge about propellants of automobiles and Class AME 231 will offer me the opportunity to learn about different properties of various materials. I will even have the chance to get in contact with the High-Performance Advanced Materials Research team to gain a deeper understanding of material selection when designing a machine. More importantly, with three design/build student projects, I will be able to get hands-on experience tinkering with all kinds of machinery and tools, while gaining experience collaborating with engineers of different backgrounds. I look forward to becoming the ace mechanic of the SAE Racing team and help bring home some championship trophies.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：USC prompt 4: Some people categorize engineers as geeks or nerds.

But my geek spirit can be trigger by various things.When my favorite game, Medieval Total War II no longer entertained me due to the “foolish” computer AI, I became determined to modify the AI myself. For several weeks, instead of playing basketball with my friends I sat in front of my computer programming to add new units and battle protocols. I spent many hours on forums asking for help and uploaded my custom AI for other players to test. ;Last year after watching a movie named “Shutter Island”, I was so outraged by the terrible and misleading subtitles that I joined an online fansub group myself to retranslate the movie. I eventually ended up translating many more.As a science fiction fanatic, the movie Alien vs. Predator compelled me to recreate the hidden pop-out blades that the Predator used. Without any clues from the movie, I had to use my imagination and designed it without any reference. Using springs as the “power source”, I designed the inner structure of the device to house the spring in a way that allowed me to utilize the spring’s maximum potential energy. After several experiments, a rough prototype elastic toy blade was born.Normally, I am just an outgoing sporty boy, but my geek cells could be evoked by random dissatisfaction and curiosity.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：How do you plan to use your engineering degree to benefit society?

The more painful work came when I was disassembling heavy parts from the chassis, enduring the smell of machine oil and tail gas. After finishing all the complicated work, I was always pleased to see a car functioning well again, but I could not help but wonder, did the repair work really have to be so complicated and involved so many heavy components. Why don’t we make things easier?After I earn my engineering degree, I would dedicate my career to designing simpler structures for automobiles, with lighter materials and cleaner energy sources. So when a car brakes down, the driver or mechanic does not have to worry too much about various shape of screws, different colors of wires or inhaling nasty fumes. By doing so I believe I can help make many people’s life easier."

I even visited the Hackescher Markt, where art works from all genres were hidden behind its mysterious gates. It was so much better in person than in a tourist book. Life was free and full of potential without the restraint of family. Within my host home things were less serene. Alice, the younger daughter of my host family, although 19-year-old, still had the mentality of a 14 year-old: irrational and impulsive, very un-German. Fights were common between her and Hans. Lea, on the other hand, always acted like the mediator and was able to find a way to calm Alice, and comfort Gabi and Hans. Lea is the fixer of the family.

Nadia from Portrait of a Spy, a controversial Arabic businesswoman turned MP-5 agent, who became indispensible in antiterrorism operations; Carrie Mathison from Homeland, who always manages to turn critical situations around with her innate ability to sense danger, and information analysis skills, amazes me. Seeing them saving the world with information and intelligence, I was fascinated by the power of information and the process of using vague clues to make speculations. ;I was drawn to cryptography games, spending hours deciphering words from random letter arrangements to look for the next clue. A single tiny mistake could potentially wipe away hours of efforts. “This must be what it feels like to be a special agent”, I thought. ;However, when I realized that the basic requirement to be recruited as a special agent in America is to be a U.S. Citizen, I knew my dreams would be gone with the wind. ;Last year, a project of creating a temperature sensing and regulating gene to insert into e.coli plasmid exposed me to the magic of biology. I found myself searching and analyzing information in a Wikipedia-like database of scientific obscurity, looking for the functions and backbones required by the recombinant DNAs. Eventually, a structure map of our plasmid, which can sense and regulate the temperature of green plants, was designed. I realized that biologist and special agents are similar in many ways: they have to be highly sensitive to information, they discover patterns, prove hypothesis, and create social impacts that can save millions of lives. ;This is why I am interested in biological research. Through making breakthroughs in research, I would have the ability to slowly change the world. In order to prevent a potential terrorism attack, a special agent in Homeland would analyze every single piece of evidence from over 30 year’s of a person’s information: from bank statement to utility bills to people he has interacted with. The tiniest piece of information can be the evidence that becomes the key of a life-saving mission. Similarly, biologists are able to prevent the next major outbreak of an epidemic by targeting a mutated gene from dead cattle. By analyzing the genetic and physical features of a certain species, biologists’ impact is beyond the lab. ;I might not be able to change the world as a special agent, but I can be among those researching telomerase to cure tumor and cancer or find a treatment for mucopolysaccharidosis, an inherited disorder with research in genetic mutation. In the hand of biology, I would have the power to make an impact, just like a special agent. ;"

Students are going to learn about the lab skills such as titration and buffers, gateway cloning, PCR and plasmid transformation. At the same time, they are going to do a research project on the functions of programmed cell death during the development of drosophila melanogaster. Through this drosophila melanogaster experiment, they are going to understand how the regulation of programmed cell death is related to cancer and tumor. Rigorous lab reports are required for each single daily experiment and a final paper will be due at the end of Phase I. The morning sessions will usually start with peer reviews and discussion. In addition, to prepare themselves with the background knowledge of drosophila melanogaster, this course will invite guest lecturers from the animal biology department. On the last day of Phase I, there will be an exam on things covered in the lectures of cellular biology and laboratory skills.Phase II is the rest of the second week and the first half of the third week. During this phase, further information about cellular biology would be given in the form of lectures every morning. Moreover, students are going to do research about the current available tumor and cancer therapies (available online or in the school library). Students are encouraged to talk with faculty from the department of physics if they are doing research on radiation therapies. Every afternoon will consist of presentations and discussions about therapies and treatments. This Phase aims at building up a general understanding of tumors, cancer and treatments, and thus preparing them for Phase III. An exam will be given to test their understanding of the lectures on the last day of this phase.For the last five days, Phase III, this course will take place off campus, in the Penrose Cancer Center (Rocky Mountain Cancer Center in Colorado Springs). Students are going to live-study the therapies that they have learnt about from the last phase and its affects on patients. Moreover, students are going to interview a staff from the cancer center to learn about genetic counseling, which are given people who want to learn about their risks of inherited cancers. At the end of this phase students will need to complete a paper about the programmed cell death application in tumor and cancer treatments, which summarizes everything they learned in this three and a half weeks.This course aims at guiding students into the field of tumor and cancer study, building up a panoramic view from the basic theories to the realistic therapies and treatments, the latest academic research, and the impacts that students can make in this field.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：How did you learn about Colorado College and why do you wish to attend?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          The word “mountain” has been so irresistible to me ever since the moment I opened the Pikes Peak Region tag on CC homepage. Always depicted as a place to start, to inspire, to reborn, mountain has been defined in this way for long and I never have any doubt; a college hugged by mountains has thus become what I long for. ;When I was reading through posts from CC students online, I found that one of the most frequently mentioned word is “liberal” (besides hippies). A liberal mountain college it is; hence, I foresee a 4-year-life with various opportunities on this campus. My passion towards biological research and bio lab has barely been able to keep me staying where I am supposed to be; Researches make up the life of a biologist. ;After spending my summer at a biology lab, I started to understand how focus and intensity win over the incremental efforts. I experienced the awkwardness of restarting my lab report after only a weekend, when 80% of my fresh memory about the experiment had been lost as Ebbinghaus curve suggested; yet I would never forget the great joy when I eventually gained the chromosome strand crawling on the glass rod after failing four times. Scientific achievements never come at ease; they are never done without a long-term focus and constant attempts.My preference to focus and intensity then draws me to the Block Plan of CC, a rare opportunity that allows me to dive into something that I am really passionate about (cancer research) for three and a half week without any interruption. At Colorado College, a school that is surrounded by mountains, liberal environment and lots of biological research opportunity, I would be on my way to start my career as a biologist."

However, my spine was shaped as a letter “S”, （with the angle of 45 degree in my chest, and 35 degree in my waist）. Sitting anxiously with my parents in the hospital, I heard the doctor’s advise of the operation treatment. As frightened as I was, I didn’t show my panic. , As I knew that my parents were hundreds more worried than I was. So I gave my parents a comforted eye look, telling them I can go through this.My beautiful hair that I cherished for years was cut off because of the need of the operation. The operation was big, I was unconscious until five hours later due to narcosis. Both sides of my spine were pinned by 8 steel nails, which were fixed by a support made of titanium alloy.The fourth week after my operation was my school orientation, I appeared in the orientation like a normal person. However, school life at that time was full of challenges and inconveniences.. Since my back could not overtake much weight, I had to drag a trolley case when everyone else were using backpacks; even though my classmates would look at me differently, I got no choice but had to wear a baseball hat everyday just like a boy, because my hair was still very short.My muscle in my waist always lost conscience during the last fifteen minutes of the class. And whenever my waist touched the chair, my wound was pressed and it hurt miserably. Thinking back what I had done so far, I refused to compromise. I told myself deeply in my heart: Yuting, don’t let all your efforts flow away. Be strong and show your optimismAs a science student, I have a heavy load of school work. However, I did not subjectively lowered my standard at any extent. No matter how late it was, finishing the homework on time and previewing the materials for the next day were included in my daily routine. Once in a math class, because of my unique and creative problem-solving ideas, I was picked up to the front to explain my method for the class. My back trembled every time I lifted my arm to write on the blackboard. Nevertheless, I still explained carefully with smile and confidence. After I finished, I heard a thunderous applause. At that time, I was so proud of myself that I believe I would overcome any hardship in the future. Throughout that whole semester, I never missed any class , and was the top 5% in my class.Because of my experience, I did some research on scoliosis. Scoliosis has a high rate (2 out of 100) among female teenagers. However, I found that most of the parents and children failed to recognize timely. Thinking that an early notice and diagnose is the key to treat this illness, I registered a public account on WeChat in order to share my own story with the public, reminding parents to check their children’s spines periodically. I also published numbers of articles regarding scoliosis, and these articles were re-posted [shared] for over 200 times. It is my pleasure to lessen others’ pain through my effort.Life is not always easy, but full of thrones and swaps. Thanks to the obstacle that I had surpassed, providing me the courage to face more difficulties with optimism in the future. I understand better to people with physical challenges, and I hope that I can spread the optimism and use my own effort to help more and more people.",
    "Supps": "题目：Describe two or three of your current intellectual interests and why they are exciting to you. Why will Cornell’s College of Arts and Sciences be the right environment in which to pursue your interests? (650 words limit)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          My first intellectual interest lies in Data Analysis and its Applications. By chance, I participated in a lecture called “Methods and Applications of Data Analysis” instructed by Professor Huiwen Wang, the Dean of Beihang University’s Complex Data Analysis and Research Center. I was amazed by the dramatic impacts of data analysis in helping government and business make decisions, such as providing advices in controlling SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). I was also attracted by data visualization, which showed how messy pieces of information form coherent pictures by star chart, bubble chart, polar area diagram, scattered plot, etc. This unforgettable experience did a great job persuading me that data can actually “speak up”.After that lecture, I kept in touch with Professor Huiwen Wang. Moved by my interest and passion, she gave me an opportunity to intern at her research project of Internet Big Data, and I was responsible for inputting all the correlated data into Excel. Over twenty days, every day for six hours, I successfully input all the data. The most exciting moment was when I clicked on the “graph” button, which presented various and clear pictures that contained meaningful interpretations. When I organized and analyzed data, I felt as if I was digging a magical diamond mine.I would like to study mathematics, especially the concentration on statistics because I have a strong interest in working with numerical data. Since being a Cornellian means to discover, preserve, and disseminate knowledge, I am certain that Cornell will help me realize my dream of becoming a data analysis scientist. Firstly, Cornel’s Department of Mathematics is formed with such knowledgeable professors, and the diverse courses. Professor Gennady Samorodnitsky, who is concentrating on Probability Theory, does researches that focus on Decadal Predictability of Extreme Events. If possible, I would like to join his research team and learn from him. Courses such as Mathematical Modeling will teach me how to implement mathematical models on the computer and how to describe the results of computational experiments. Writing in Mathematics enables me to “think as a mathematician”. I am also deeply attracted by the abundant events in Cornell, such as the seminar hosted every Wednesday by Department of Statistics, where there are speakers including researchers across fields speaking on current topics in Statistics and presenting new research directions. Seminars such as “Distributed Statistical Algotithms” by Gerard Biau, The Signal and the Noise by Nate silver are very attractive to me. I can get access to the most advanced researches and creative ideas. Furthermore, to gain a practical hands-on knowledge, I will treasure Cornell’s research opportunities to the fullest, such as Summer Project—Graphs, Chip-Firing Games, and Algebraic Geometry directed by Professor Farbod Shokrieh.Another of my intellectual interests is teaching. Since I was little, I always enjoyed imitating the way teachers taught little kids. In elementary school, I started showing interest in tutoring my cousin on a scratch paper. In high school, my favorite “activity” is presentation, especially explaining and articulating the problem solving process in class, which would make me feel like contributing what I learn to others in need. Thus, I would like to participate in career-oriented activities, including the Undergraduate Course Assistant, Undergraduate Tutor for the Mathematics Support Center, and further engage in various community services, such as Big Red Buddies and Encourage Young Engineers and Scientists (EYES) to promote more children to love science. I can imagine how content I will feel if I could become a teaching assistant or tutor, so that Ican not only share my understandings of mathematics to others, but also help students who have difficulties in learning mathematics or statistics.In a word, Cornell, with its beautiful campus, is a perfect environment for me to realize my dream in the near future.

    "CommonApp": "Despite growing up in a picture perfect family, the idea of “family” scared me. Parents’ overbearing love usually comes with obligations and expectations. Whenever I share my fantasy of becoming a journalist, a special agent or a scientific researcher, they would laugh and respond with “Marriage and grandchildren most important!”That is why I was extremely excited on my flight from Hong Kong to Frankfurt to start my yearlong exchange program in Germany, a place free of obligations and expectations. Everything went perfectly after arriving in Berlin. I was welcomed by the serene scene of the Spree curving outside my bedroom window. Gabi and Hans, my host parents, maintained a rational, systematic and well organized home: the perfect definition of a German family. We went on family hikes that took place everywhere in the city: along the Pankow River, in the Charlottenburg Garten, and even a one day tour dissecting West Berlin. I even visited the Hackescher Markt, where art works from all genres were hidden behind its mysterious gates. It was so much better in person than in a tourist book. Life was free and full of potential without the restraint of family. Within my host home things were less serene. Alice, the younger daughter of my host family, although 19-year-old, still had the mentality of a 14 year-old: irrational and impulsive, very un-German. Fights were common between her and Hans. Lea, on the other hand, always acted like the mediator and was able to find a way to calm Alice, and comfort Gabi and Hans. Lea is the fixer of the family. We talked a lot, from her job as a nurse to the differences between China and Germany. She was surprised when I told her that Chinese families are so tight that no secrets are permitted. One time, I asked Lea her opinion of Alice. “Alice is still searching for herself. She needs time and space. She is not psycho, just reckless. I have been through every big and small fight between them. I knew she would come around. I just want her to know I am here for her, no matter what.”What she said went against everything I believed about Germans. I always thought that the organized social system and straightforward personalities of German people would have a hard time tolerating someone as irrational and illogical as Alice. She might be everything that a German is not, but her family still accepted her for who she was and were patient enough to let her find herself. As much as I hate to admit, I was just like her. Sometimes I get stressed out by the trivial things; such as failing to write a basic program in JAVA or losing five straight matches in a table tennis competition. I get intolerant and temperamental; I become a brat. Fortunately, my parents, like Lea, were always patient enough, never scolding me and patiently waiting for me to come around. They support my hobbies that I have no talent for and they never criticize me for quitting. My family, something I thought was restricting me, has actually been nurturing my adventurous and ambitious personalities. I left Berlin with not only the wonderful experience of German culture and a fluent language, but also a better understanding of family. “Sweetie, you want to go out for a walk after dinner?” my father asked. Instead of responding with “not scheduled ahead of time enough” to avoid his disruption of my future plans, I answered “Sure, dad, coming right out.” Maybe I will never be able to change their expectations of me or I will always do something laughable to them. But I know, at the end, they will be there for me no matter how bad I fail or what I choose to do.",

    "CommonApp": "Once, I met a stranger in Shanghai, along an old road in The Bund. “Thank you for taking this photo of me,” he said. “Although this may be the only time we will ever meet in our lifetime, I hope you will remember my face, and I will remember yours, to appreciate the powers of fate.” It invoked a strange melancholy towards all the strangers in my life I’ll never see again. Another time in Lucerne, a street violinist casually mentioned, “Wouldn’t you agree it’s like heaven here, standing in the breeze and sunshine, enjoying your own music, while appreciating the lovely smiles of passersby?” Indeed it became the most memorable part of my trip.My world is a collection of these memories that connect me to those around. Underneath the plain exterior is so much that pass unnoticed. My dream is to uncover these stories and broaden the web that brings communities together.In my early childhood, I spent many days sitting under the dim yellow light with my grandpa, a math teacher with interests in many different subjects, who passed on many of his views towards learning and life. Exposed to various Chinese traditions, like calligraphy, literature, and even esoteric abacus arithmetic, I learnt to appreciate the beauty in diverse forms of expression. Through my grandpa’s narrative, Tao Yuanming and Li bai became my mentors, painting poems that uncovered deep-rooted emotions and conditions permeating society. Now grown up, I realize that grandpa instilled an important habit in me to pay close attention to, and appreciate the bountiful stories of the past and present. I craved for encounters with individuals like the old man and the violinist, for their stories and ideas.Then in high school, I discovered the school publication, Nirvana Weekly—a haven for me to pursue these stories. But what began with conducting interviews and investigations became written words that would convey what I learned into articles read by thousands.My first article was an interview with Mr. Wu, one of the million individuals who illegally entered British-ruled Hong Kong from Mainland China between the 1950s and 1980s. With a cup of tea in his hand, he talked about the starvation and political turmoil he faced in China that compelled him to swim across the freezing Shenzhen Bay. I also learned of the life that awaited him, filled with starvation, discrimination, and constant fear of being captured. Ultimately, he overcame the struggles, and after years of struggle, transformed into a respected engineer.“Longjing tea of the best quality.” He pointed at the leaves in his cup. “What I experienced is just like it—bitter at first but sweet afterwards.”Mr. Wu’s story taught me to cherish the life I had, but I wasn’t the only one affected. “I never considered life this way before,” a reader wrote. Many commenters later poured in similar sentiments, thanking me for uncovering such a profound story.That’s when I determined the importance of communicating ideas, to affect others the same way stories have affected me. I dream to show others the world they’ve overlooked, to discover the magnificent stories of ordinary street musicians and esoteric knowledge of distant countries. That is what motivated me to pursue journalism, a place where I can liberally explore the world and spread what I’ve seen. Then from these stories, I hope others may find inspiration and gain confidence to pursue their own goals, to form their own stories to leave behind some day.",
    "Supps": "题目：Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience that is important to you. What about this quality or accomplishment makes you proud and how does it relate to the person you are?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I think I am compulsive. I realized it when, the first time I found an unsolved Rubik’s cube on the shelf of a toy shop, I became overwhelmingly distressed by the disorderly patches of colors. They seemed pleading to be restored, so I spent two hours patiently tending it, until my persistence convinced my mom to buy it.Unfortunately, my compulsive spirit continued to plague me. The first time I watched The Matrix trilogy, I was confounded by countless themes. Names like Zion, Apoc, and Seraph contained Judeo-Christian references to the Book of Revelations; When Neo fights Morpheus in the training program, the recurring Yin-yang contrasts between the characters and environment seemed suggestive of Taoist ideals of harmony. Were Neo and Smith none other than Nietzsche and Schopenhauer under guise? What did the Wachowski brothers want to convey to us? Am I crazy? I don’t know, but it upset me that I didn’t have the answer. I would later own my copy, and ruminate the plot thoroughly. ;My ultimate accomplishment must be attributed to music rhythm games. During a certain period, this typical game captivated school campus as students religiously huddled around computers and laptops, outscoring one another with finger dexterity that can put expert pianists to shame. It requires propensity towards music rhythm, and instant reaction to match. With my love of playing instruments, it was addiction at first sight.Today, I can solve the Rubik’s cube in 1.5 minutes, and can also complete other variations like the 4x4 master’s cube. I have watched the Matrix series over ten times, exploring themes of fatalism and karma. In addition, I have won numerous competitions in rhythm games around the city, and according to a global online ranking system, I am ranked in the world’s top 150—an achievement I am quite proud of.In retrospect, I have to be grateful for my compulsive impulse, for it instilled the desire to pour practice in the things I love—things that require intricate attention to details and challenging analysis. These experiences have unintentionally given me confidence to persist and succeed in challenges I encounter, and an addiction for improvement.As I play a track for my friends, I unfortunately must have scared them.“How can you even follow those notes? You’re a robot!”“Actually,” I laughed, “I’m compulsive.”"

    "CommonApp": "In the past several years there is an impulse that influences my decisions, including my decision to study abroad. Yet I cannot figure out what it is. It bothers me so I decide to try a unique method from Steve Pavlina to address it.I close the window and curtains, preventing even a single beam of sunlight from entering. I turn off Bach’s organ concerto that has been playing on my sound box, along with my cell phone and computer. The room is drenched in complete darkness and silence, inducing a serene paradise for introspection.On a large piece of paper, I scrawl blindly, “WHAT DO I WANT IN LIFE?” I feel funny about what I am doing—thinking about such big matters in such big letters. My mood then is light-hearted.I am required to write down the first thing from my mind, repeating until I feel finished.I had pizza for lunch, my favorite food, so I wrote: “Have pizza every day.” It’s not hard at all. I smiled skeptically, but continued.“Play rhythm games all day.” “A room full of guitars—classical, electronic and folk guitars.” “Watch sci-fi movies like Matrix and Star Wars.”I realized I was substituting the original question with a less abstract, “What makes you happy?” It’s rather misleading; I want things that make me happy, but it’s more than pizza. I take a deep breath.I recall the euphoria from unraveling intricacies like algebra problems or Rubik’s cube, but particularly from books detailing the most profound obscurities of life. As the eyes traverse the lines, stalking the contemplations of the writer, the mind is provoked, challenged, and molded. From Amusing Ourselves to Death, I was appalled at the effortless sway of media on society’s subconscious, which instilled in me the duty of responsible journalism that I strive to impart in Nirvana Weekly. From The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I now know that the ultimate answer to the universe is 42.I once came across Schopenhauer’s claim that “one can do what he will, but in any given moment of life one can will only definite things.” In other words, our decisions are limited to possibilities we can conceive, in turn limited by what we know. I contemplated this idea, and wrote down: “I never want to stop broadening my range of cognition through learning and experience.”Well, what next?I recall a stranger I met in Shanghai, along an old road in The Bund. “Thank you for taking this photo of me. Although this may be the only time we will ever meet in our lifetime, I hope you will remember my face, and I will remember yours, to appreciate the powers of fate.” It invoked a strange melancholy towards all the strangers in my life I’ll never see again.Another time in Lucerne, a street violinist casually mentioned, “Wouldn’t you agree it’s like heaven here, standing in the breeze and sunshine, enjoying your own music, while appreciating the lovely smiles of passersby?” Indeed it was the most memorable moment of my trip.And once, while my roommate and I were brushing our teeth: “Did you know the Klein Bottle is a three-dimensional counterpart of the Möbius Strip? Except we’ll never see the Klein Bottle’s real four-dimensional form besides through abstract math formulas. Isn’t that a pity?”These moments leave lasting impressions on me, reminding me of the stories and ideas that are lost forever if I hesitate to seize them. So I wrote down: “I never want to stop connecting with others.”But that isn’t enough. I desire to spread this attitude to remind everyone to slow down for the fleeting stories and ideas present in everyday life. They may be simple beauty of life worth remembering, ideas worth spreading, or perhaps opportunities to make a difference. If everyone listened, the world will become a different place.",

    "CommonApp": "Once, I met a stranger in Shanghai, along an old road in The Bund. “Thank you for taking this photo of me,” he said. “Although this may be the only time we will ever meet in our lifetime, I hope you will remember my face, and I will remember yours, to appreciate the powers of fate.” It invoked a strange melancholy towards all the strangers in my life I’ll never see again. Another time in Lucerne, a street violinist casually mentioned, “Wouldn’t you agree it’s like heaven here, standing in the breeze and sunshine, enjoying your own music, while appreciating the lovely smiles of passersby?” Indeed it became the most memorable part of my trip.My world is a collection of these memories that connect me to those around. Underneath the plain exterior is so much that pass unnoticed. My dream is to uncover these stories and broaden the web that brings communities together.In my early childhood, I spent many days sitting under the dim yellow light with my grandpa, a math teacher with interests in many different subjects, who passed on many of his views towards learning and life. Exposed to various Chinese traditions, like calligraphy, literature, and even esoteric abacus arithmetic, I learnt to appreciate the beauty in diverse forms of expression. Through my grandpa’s narrative, Tao Yuanming and Li bai became my mentors, painting poems that uncovered deep-rooted emotions and conditions permeating society. Now grown up, I realize that grandpa instilled an important habit in me to pay close attention to, and appreciate the bountiful stories of the past and present. I craved for encounters with individuals like the old man and the violinist, for their stories and ideas.Then in high school, I discovered the school publication, Nirvana Weekly—a haven for me to pursue these stories. But what began with conducting interviews and investigations became written words that would convey what I learned into articles read by thousands.My first article was an interview with Mr. Wu, one of the million individuals who illegally entered British-ruled Hong Kong from Mainland China between the 1950s and 1980s. With a cup of tea in his hand, he talked about the starvation and political turmoil he faced in China that compelled him to swim across the freezing Shenzhen Bay. I also learned of the life that awaited him, filled with starvation, discrimination, and constant fear of being captured. Ultimately, he overcame the struggles, and after years of struggle, transformed into a respected engineer.“Longjing tea of the best quality.” He pointed at the leaves in his cup. “What I experienced is just like it—bitter at first but sweet afterwards.”Mr. Wu’s story taught me to cherish the life I had, but I wasn’t the only one affected. “I never considered life this way before,” a reader wrote. Many commenters later poured in similar sentiments, thanking me for uncovering such a profound story.That’s when I determined the importance of communicating ideas, to affect others the same way stories have affected me. I dream to show others the world they’ve overlooked, to discover the magnificent stories of ordinary street musicians and esoteric knowledge of distant countries. That is what motivated me to pursue journalism, a place where I can liberally explore the world and spread what I’ve seen. Then from these stories, I hope others may find inspiration and gain confidence to pursue their own goals, to form their own stories to leave behind some day.",

Yeats travelled along the coast of Ireland, his beloved motherland, collecting tales and folklore of fairies and ghosts from his Irish countrymen. The stories—compiled together with Yeats own verse—became the Celtic Twilight.Yeats’ narrative convinced me that fairy tales were not just for children. The native Irish spoke of fairies and mythical creatures as if they truly existed alongside them at home, “for in Ireland there is something of timid affection between men and spirits.” Sometimes fairies brought good fortune, and in return, food was prepared for these deities. Irish men and women gossiped of them like they were neighbors, even leaving doors open when people passed away, so spirits could enter and attend the departing soul. ;Yeats concluded with a profound, “Everything exists, everything is true, and the earth is only a little dust under our feet.” He questions what ‘existence’ is, to expand its inclusion of everything relevant to human expression, whether material or imagined.Yes, spirits, fairies, even heaven and hell, are forms of coping with unknown. As science continues to progress, these stories that once explained the mysteries of our universe are ceded to logic and rationality. However, that doesn’t even make them less valuable.When I was 8 I learned how the rainbow was merely the refraction of light, but it still remained magnificent to behold. I don’t believe in worshipping baseless ideologies. He only convinced me to respect them. While keeping rational, we still should leave space for fairy tales, retaining that appreciation for myths and fairy tales, respecting them for their cultural and historical importance to those in the past who depended on them, or simply for their beauty.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：We are a community with quirks, both in language (we’ll welcome you to Grounds, not campus) and in traditions.

    "Supps": "题目：Describe two or three of your current intellectual interests and why they are exciting to you. Why will Cornell's College of Arts and Sciences be the right environment in which to pursue your interests? (Please limit your response to 650 words.)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Information Science - Neil Postman once claimed that media is like a metaphor, not only shaping language but also shaping thought. I am an enthusiastic fan of social media, from Twitter to Facebook to Chinese Weibo—mediums for reading news, interacting with friends, and sharing our thoughts on anything from books to personal life. These new media platforms emerging from technological advance connected me to interesting people and ideas around the world. Shaped by these influences, Nirvana Weekly (our school journalism) has increased transparency across within our school, to motivate students to care more about their community and the society. These experiences have drawn me to the field of informational science, so I can better utilize the varying forms of media for pursuing more open communication.Mathematics - Why is math exciting? It’s the same reason why computer games are exciting—the empowering feeling of individual planning, the analysis using logic and insight, and taking full responsibility for win or defeat. Solving a complex algebra problem or figuring out the auxiliary lines to most efficiently prove a geometry theorem is a thrill unlike any other. It is also through mathematics that we develop our daily life and other sciences. Things as trivial as paying for your lunch or as glorious as determining the number of curled dimensions of space hidden in our universe, all point to the resounding importance of math.Lastly, I am immensely drawn to philosophy - When I first watched The Matrix series, the following dialogue confounded me, exposing me to hidden meanings behind commonality.“Don’t worry about the vase,” said the Oracle.“What vase?”(Neo starts looking around, accidentally breaking the vase beside him.)“The problem is, would you still have broken it if I hadn’t said anything?”After watching The Matrix countless times, I slowly realized how the crux of the entire series was hinged on this dialogue, filled with fatalism and various interpretations of “free will”. For the first time I was exposed to alternate views towards world and life. Matrix may be deeply profound, but life is even more complex and intricate, with far more equivocal choices and possibilities. From that startling point, I delved into Plato, Schopenhauer, and even Marx. From Schopenhauer I came to believe that we are bound by what we know. His theories inspired me to experience more, and to learn more in order to make better choices.This brings me to Cornell, with their perfect Informational Science department that few other schools possess. Through a systematical list of courses, I will be able to understand how deep technology has transformed humanity, and the way people communicate. I was also amazed by its interdisciplinary nature. Computer Science, Communications, Economics, Sociology, Applied Math, all require extensive thinking and analyzing, all providing me the thrill I seek, and the knowledge I desire. Among all the courses, Professor Tarleton Gillespie’s New Media and Society appeals to me the most. Indeed, “We are all immersed in a complex and pervasive media culture”, as written in the course synopsis. From the course, I believe I will gain deeper insight on the impact of new media on society, and will learn how to use my analytical skills to face the ever-changing landscape of media. Cornell is also a perfect place to separately pursue math and philosophy—my pursuits of happiness. Oliver Club, along with annual Kieval lectures delivered, and the Math Puzzle Sessions, together create an unconventional but attractive atmosphere for studying math non-professionally. Meanwhile, the philosophy department of Cornell provides interesting first-year writing seminar programs, which provides a great opportunity for me to partake in discussions. Also, the Norman Kretzmann Undergraduate Philosophy Lecture offers fresh opportunities to communicate with the greatest contemporary minds. This is Cornell, where a diverse array of resources awaits my varying interests, and a place I belong to."

    "CommonApp": "I was never a thin kid. When I was little, my relatives joked that I somehow “absorbed excess nutrients.” In the summertime, while my friends confidently wore vests and showed off their slim figures, I often sweated in heavy coats to cloak my shape. In class, with my peers raising their hands assuredly, I stayed quiet, convinced people would ignore what I had to say and simply judge me by how fat I looked.One last “friendly reminder” from my aunt finally pushed me over the edge. Feeling defeated, I stared at my bloated body and swollen fingers in the mirror. Tears streaming down my face, I was finally forced to admit to myself that my indiscriminate eating and non-active lifestyle were fueling my ballooning figure. Nothing occurred to me but the firm belief that it was time to confront my self-abased behaviors, build a better body and reconstruct my broken confidence.My weight loss journey was difficult. It started with harsh diets. As a long-time food-lover, my desire for delicious, familiar foods was nearly unbearable. Gone were the days when I could eat whatever I wanted, however I wanted. Only three days into my diet, I gave in, and ravenously ate plates full of my forbidden delicacies. Once I was full, however, I was haunted by guilt. I had betrayed myself once again. But I wasn’t ready to give up. Recruiting my friends for support, I started again. Together, we set workout goals and weight loss targets. Dividing themselves into two teams, my friends joined me for runs everyday after school. Dragging my feet along the track, I realized how truly heavy my body was, and how urgently I needed to change. Hearing the concerned encouragement, I continued struggling to put one chubby foot in front of the other.I could sense things getting easier. Soon, I had memorized the calorie counts for most common foods and could quickly calculate my daily intake. Logging my miles, I saw my daily runs creep up from a labored 0.5 miles per day to a confident, brisk 4 miles per day. My friend’s daily, positive words slowly began to block out the harmful taunts from my relatives that I had internalized for so many years. Meanwhile, the number on the scale slowly began to drop.Eventually I reached my target weight-loss of 45lbs. Looking in my closet, my loose-fitting clothes chronicle the weight that I lost and the inner strength that I gained. Taking control of my of my weight, I realized, for the first time, my own potential, resilience and limitlessness. Once, I was a girl who let others make me feel ugly and small. Now, when I stare at myself in the mirror, I recognize no matter what I was told, no matter what I thought I was capable of, I can always do more. With each lap run and pound lost, I reclaimed my confidence and recognized my own limitless and worth whatever I performed.",

During our meals, my grandmother would spin the dim sum turntable, positioning the freshest dishes in front of me, gently smiling while I wolfed down the food. Reflecting the warmth of each dish, those meals symbolize her earnest love for me. With each bite, I swallowed my grandma’s kindness and learned what it truly meant to care for others. ;Fried fish with my father taught me about perseverance.My dad and I often share fried fish together. His adoration for fried food comes, however, not only from the taste but also from the spirit behind it: only after high temperatures and scalding oil can the raw ingredients transform into delicious delicacies. ;When my father first started his own business, he encountered nothing but challenges. Yet after fearlessly beating through many grievous moments, he achieved success. Those flashes of anguish and suffering made him, just like the burning oil makes fried food, and he is now a passionate and tough man who fights vigorously for what he desires. Every time I have fried fish, I taste my father’s attitudes towards life through the burnt surface and become determined to pursue my dreams persistently, just as he did.Laohuo soup with my mother taught me about persistence.My mom’s traditional Chinese laohuo clear soup is like a delicious art form. When I asked my mother about her secret recipes, she told me the sole secret: patience and practice. She can spend hours preparing the soup’s materials and will carefully pour them into the boiling water, conforming to a prescribed order that took her over twenty years to perfect. Sipping the satisfying dish, I’ve come to admire my mom’s meticulous exactness and pursuit of perfection. ;Dim sum, fried fish and laohuo soup. These are the components that have largely shaped who I am today, and nurtured my dream to become a human rights lawyer. ;My grandmother’s kindness taught me to care for other people, and to share warmth with those in need. When I see discrimination against women, socioeconomic inequality, and various other social problems, I see a place where I can share this same warmth and love.My mother’s patience and practice have shown me how to successfully find solutions. Specifically, through her careful cooking methods, I learned the importance of taking time to carefully understand causes of problems and to never stop looking for solutions. Extended to human rights, listening and understanding the plights of the disenfranchised and marginalized people of society will help me best utilize my skills to serve them. ;Lastly, I am aware that this road to becoming a lawyer will be long and arduous, but with my father’s influence, I know I will be able to persevere regardless of whatever challenges I may face."

    "CommonApp": "In the past several years there is an impulse that influences my decisions, including my decision to study abroad. Yet I cannot figure out what it is. It bothers me so I decide to try a unique method from Steve Pavlina to address it.I close the window and curtains, preventing even a single beam of sunlight from entering. I turn off Bach’s organ concerto that has been playing on my sound box, along with my cell phone and computer. The room is drenched in complete darkness and silence, inducing a serene paradise for introspection.On a large piece of paper, I scrawl blindly, “WHAT DO I WANT IN LIFE?” I feel funny about what I am doing—thinking about such big matters in such big letters. My mood then is light-hearted.I am required to write down the first thing from my mind, repeating until I feel finished.I had pizza for lunch, my favorite food, so I wrote: “Have pizza every day.” It’s not hard at all. I smiled skeptically, but continued.“Play rhythm games all day.” “A room full of guitars—classical, electronic and folk guitars.” “Watch sci-fi movies like Matrix and Star Wars.”I realized I was substituting the original question with a less abstract, “What makes you happy?” It’s rather misleading; I want things that make me happy, but it’s more than pizza. I take a deep breath.I recall the euphoria from unraveling intricacies like algebra problems or Rubik’s cube, but particularly from books detailing the most profound obscurities of life. As the eyes traverse the lines, stalking the contemplations of the writer, the mind is provoked, challenged, and molded. From Amusing Ourselves to Death, I was appalled at the effortless sway of media on society’s subconscious, which instilled in me the duty of responsible journalism that I strive to impart in Nirvana Weekly. From The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I now know that the ultimate answer to the universe is 42.I once came across Schopenhauer’s claim that “one can do what he will, but in any given moment of life one can will only definite things.” In other words, our decisions are limited to possibilities we can conceive, in turn limited by what we know. I contemplated this idea, and wrote down: “I never want to stop broadening my range of cognition through learning and experience.”Well, what next?I recall a stranger I met in Shanghai, along an old road in The Bund. “Thank you for taking this photo of me. Although this may be the only time we will ever meet in our lifetime, I hope you will remember my face, and I will remember yours, to appreciate the powers of fate.” It invoked a strange melancholy towards all the strangers in my life I’ll never see again.Another time in Lucerne, a street violinist casually mentioned, “Wouldn’t you agree it’s like heaven here, standing in the breeze and sunshine, enjoying your own music, while appreciating the lovely smiles of passersby?” Indeed it was the most memorable moment of my trip.And once, while my roommate and I were brushing our teeth: “Did you know the Klein Bottle is a three-dimensional counterpart of the Möbius Strip? Except we’ll never see the Klein Bottle’s real four-dimensional form besides through abstract math formulas. Isn’t that a pity?”These moments leave lasting impressions on me, reminding me of the stories and ideas that are lost forever if I hesitate to seize them. So I wrote down: “I never want to stop connecting with others.”But that isn’t enough. I desire to spread this attitude to remind everyone to slow down for the fleeting stories and ideas present in everyday life. They may be simple beauty of life worth remembering, ideas worth spreading, or perhaps opportunities to make a difference. If everyone listened, the world will become a different place.",

I was exposed to alternate, but equally acceptable views in life, attracting me to the subject of philosophy, or more broadly, humanities.Humanities is what distinguishes humans from animals: while social and natural sciences are the study of external observations for empirical answers, humanities is the introspection of human life and all that enriches how we outwardly connect with others.

It is from a familiar user, so I click into it only to discover an empty post. Skimming across the meaningless comments from other users, I smile before clicking the red X on the upright corner. Must be the academic stress of the season.We have connected several times by now, once to clarify the “monotonicity” of derivative functions, and another to debate whether it was unawareness or intentional disregard of school policy by teachers disallowing mobile phones in class. Each time, he managed to convince me with his insightful reasoning. From our conversations, I deem him an interesting person, amongst those few we encounter in life. However, beyond the whimsical discussions, we never interacted further.A month later, I clicked into the same post again, finding an outpour of comments like “Saddened” and “He was so young. Why?”A sense of foreboding spilled from my gut; the day before, a senior student had jumped from a building and died. I did not dwell on it too much when I first heard the news, because after all, suicides are the leading cause of death amongst high school students in China, common knowledge to us. We’ve learned to tune out those news before they can distract us from the important examinations. That was before I found out it was him.Scrolling down the page rereading our shared discussions, a sense of hollowness emerged, knowing that his voice no longer existed.“Your idea reminds me of ‘Brain in a vat’, an interesting thought experiment. Yet following the principle of Occam's razor, I choose not to believe in it.”“I also can’t wait to watch the new season of Big Bang!”“Cheers for Lakers!”On his profile page, I found this surreptitious greeting: “Welcome! I wish you happiness everyday.”I wonder what he was thinking when he typed those words. Perhaps the word ‘happiness’ for him was just polite greeting. But I really yearn go back and wake him up, to tell him it’s more than that. Happiness is the feeling of waking up in the morning to see breakfast made by mum. Happiness is pushing boundaries of life to finally achieve great goals. Happiness is noticing the beauty that passes by in daily life.  ;Happiness is everywhere in daily life. Why couldn’t he see that?“My life is like a play, which at the moment lack funds, performers, and script.”The support from your family and friends are the biggest funds; you yourself are the most extraordinary performer; And script? The best script in the world was there all along—your experiences overcoming challenges, finding love, and building accomplishments are what define your film. Everyone has an awesome script. It’s only that sometimes we need someone to remind us of it, and that’s what I’m here for."

    "CommonApp": "My oil painting teacher, Mrs. Wu Xiaoyan, once told our class that, before committing oneself to painting, the most significant task was to notice the elusive temperatures of the light and gentle shadows in the scenery. She instructed us to be meticulous in our preparation -- paying close attention to hue, properly mixing diverse colors, squinting at the color charts to ensure chromatic accuracy– as this was the most important step to creating a successful painting. At the time, I did not appreciate this instruction. Precocious and overeager, I believed that paying so much attention to something so subtle was unnecessarily time-consuming and demanding. As a result, the atmosphere of my earliest paintings fell flat. When compared with the original scenery, my paintings were glutted with distorted objects, excessive light shadow, and unsightly, rough lumps of color. Though I had thrown my full enthusiasm and vigor into my paintings, they fell far short of my artistic goal.Disappointed, I decided to revisit Mrs. Wu’s instructions and began to take the time to observe the nature that I was trying to capture. Wielding this new approach, my art flourished. With Mrs. Wu at the helm, our art class became an open forum for me to express my ideas. Together with my classmates, we were like the singers in Barratier’s Les Choristes, except, instead of a piano, we had canvas. Paying attention to each brushstroke, our paintings became painstaking efforts to convey our own creativity and internal values through the most perfect medium that we knew how. Through this class, Mrs. Wu showed me that meaning exists in details. Before, I generally focused on main colors, textures, and subjects. Now, I am apt to perceive technique: how to use brushstrokes to depict landscapes, people, and objects; how to choose the most desirable angle to portray subjects. As a result, my artwork has become more vivid and accurate to my vision.These lessons in nuance, however, have extended far beyond painting. They have led me to perceive the world from different, more complex angles. Before, when I traveled to a new place, I would just “enjoy” impressive sceneries: I appreciated the beautiful night view of Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbor and applauded the superb architecture of Shanghai Oriental Pearl Tower. Gradually though, with the help of painting, I learned to dig deeper. I researched the origins of Victoria Harbor and examined the intricate beaming of the Tower. These abilities found their way into my study habits as well. In the past, my teachers would have us recite passages from textbooks, such as the exact dates of the French Revolution or the watershed of World War II. After painting, I began to explore these key points beyond class. I talked about them with my classmates or found relevant books in the library or online. I began to see how much information existed below my previous surface-level analysis.Maybe most importantly, this newfound perceptiveness has helped me find nuances within myself: my merits, my faults, things that need to be improve, things that need to be perfected. Before – just like with my art – I was complacent. Subtle questions such as how to best communicate with others, how to control my temper, or how to balance my academic study and extracurricular activities were glossed over. I didn’t think these subtleties mattered. Yet as painting became a larger part of my life, I gradually began to view my life in the same way that I viewed my paintings: with a careful, critical eye. I looked to discover my merits and nurture them, find my faults and vices and eradicate them. Through a focus on details, I learned how create a more perfect, well-rounded version of myself.The Irish poet Oscar Wilde famously said that “life imitates art.” From my experience, I must agree. Although I have made my paintings, my paintings have arguably done more to make me.",
    "Supps": "题目：USC students are known to be involved. Briefly describe a non-academic pursuit (such as service to community or family, a club or sport, or work, etc.,) that best illustrates who you are, and why it is important to you. (250 word limit)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I have always had an interest in environmental conservation and sustainability. Thus, to explore this interest from an industrial angle, I worked as a sewage treatment assistant in the Red Apple Furniture Company factory in the summers following the 10th and 11th grade.Attending the internship was my first real-world experience related to sustainability and waste-water management. During my time at the company, I had various hands-on opportunities relating to water purification, such as operating wastewater sludge pumps, reading and interpreting data from the liquid level meter, and ensuring the quality of processed water. I also learned about the science behind sewage treatment, including precipitation of solid wastes, separation and filtration techniques, and even anaerobic-aerobic activated sludge neutralization.Beyond industrial knowledge, this internship also played a significant role in shaping my future goals. Seeing the complicated water purification process first-hand showed me just how incredibly toxic untreated wastewater is. I was thus shocked and dismayed to learn that currently, there are still many factories that dump untreated wastes into rivers, where these chemicals can enter into irrigation and water supplies. After my internship, this irresponsible action is unacceptable to me.Growing up near Dongguan, a heavily polluted industrial area in southern China, I already had a strong desire to utilize chemistry to attack environmental problems. My sewage treatment internship strengthened this previous interest in environmental chemistry and made me more determined to combat currently inadequate wastewater management policies and environmental remediation projects.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe your academic interests and how you plan to pursue them at USC.

There, I saw rivers that had turned sickly shades of green and red due to heavy metal pollution. Nearby, trees had few leaves and grew deformed fruits.  ;Seeing such appalling pollution mere hours away from my home, I realized the severity of environmental chemistry-related problems and felt a new urgency to address them.With these interests in chemistry and environmental conservation, I can think of no better place than USC to spend my next four years.Of its many offerings, USC’s “Freshman Science Honors Program (FSH)” is a particularly attractive option to explore my chemistry interests. Here, with individualized attention from faculty, I can build a strong foundation in the natural sciences, cultivate my multidisciplinary research abilities, learn the basics of experimental design, and frequently share my ideas with other enthusiastic, likeminded USC Trojans. ;In relation to sustainability, USC is an ideal place for study due to the “Center for Sustainable Cities”, which aims to tackle metropolitan sustainability challenges. Through the center, I could become involved in projects that work to create innovative solutions to current pollution problems. I believe these sorts of projects would be a perfect capstone to my USC experience, linking my environmental interests with hands-on research experiences and real-life environmental field study.In the future, I wish to become a scholastic and skillful chemist, faithful to my community, who will courageously and ambitiously tackle environmental problems. USC’s plentiful resources can help me achieve this goal."

From a mini-racing car, a night-light in a chocolate box, to a spring driven wheel, we built many silly things together. These little practices accustomed me to structural analysis and abstract thinking, as well as gaining hands-on skills.After the infernal chopsticks embarrassed me as I dropped food on the table over and over again, I started project Chop-X. With my father’s help, I developed a well-designed prototype after numerous attempts and hundreds of hours at a local workshop. To my surprise, I was not the only one who could benefit from it. After learning about patients who suffered severe hand injuries, resulting in difficulties using normal tableware, I made more copies of Chop-X and showed patients how to use it in the hospital. Hearing them say “Thank you for making us feel normal again” made me realize what I could do with my limited but practical knowledge.The mechanism of Chop-X, based on elementary school physics, might be laughable in front of cutting-edge innovations and probably won’t make me a millionaire inventor. But it represents why I want to study engineering: to help the disadvantaged minorities with practical scientific knowledge. ;The College of Engineering at CMU is an ideal place for me to become the type of engineer I want to be. The 24-series courses will provide me with many opportunities to gain hand-on experience through learning the operations of different machines and building “soft robots” and other prototypes in the Machine Shop.  ;Moreover, I am attracted to the Robotics Institute (RI), where I can find a wide array of research projects focused on applying robotics to aid our lives. Particularly, I am inspired by the projects aimed to solve easily ignored problems such as the “Hand Held Force Magnifier” that would enhance the accuracy of delicate surgeries or the “Assistive Robots for Blind Travelers” to aid the blind. By pursuing a minor in RI, and interacting with the professors I hope to get involved with research projects and develop ideas where I can use robotics to improve Chop-X, and gain inspiration for future endeavors. ;CMU’s volunteer opportunities are abundant, from the Volunteer Fair to numerous clubs and organizations, giving me the opportunity to become a socially engaged engineer. I look forward to using the knowledge I learn from CMU to contribute in programs like Global Medical Brigades or Engineers Without Boarders, to help make an impact in improving the lives of the disadvantaged. ;At CMU, not only can I become an engineer that is knowledgeable enough to solve a problem, handy enough to create a solution, but also have the opportunity to give aid to those who needs it most. ;"

    "CommonApp": "When I was four, my father gave me my first set of 3D puzzle. Since then, I have been enthralled by these magical pieces that are cut out of flat wood pieces and cardboard yet can form into any tridimensional model I wanted: animals, vehicles, buildings, and more. Witnessing my immersion into this new hobby my father realized that I had inherited his genes.  As an engineer himself, he took advantage of every opportunity when some appliance in the house needed fixing, to show me the mechanisms and engineering principals behind them. Even though I had no idea what he was talking about most of the time then, I enjoyed spending time with him, seeing his glow of excitement while explaining fanatically with his pen and sketch paper. We also built lots of small gadgets together in our free time: a mini racing car, a night-light in a chocolate box, a spring driven wheel, and many other silly things. For the last 10 years, my father has worked as an administrator for the Department of Local Technology Development, which granted him the access to many local innovations such as paper-like electronic books, small robot guard dogs, bone-conduction earphones, cloud computing and 3D printing technology. Playing around with these products without instructions was always an adventure for me; where amazing and mysterious functions awaits my discovery. At home, there was never a shortage of new toys for me to play with, take apart, and reverse engineer. When the embarrassment of not knowing how to use chopsticks properly forced me to try out a long existing idea of making a pair of simplified chopsticks, my father helped me explore the process of bringing an idea to life. With a little guidance I found workshops that would make stainless steel legs for me, resources to study the process of patent filing, and learned to use a 3D modeling software for my design. I hit a lot of bumps along the road but eventually I was able to create something of great use and meaning to me. While this pair of modified chopsticks, Chop-X, was originally intended to serve myself, I unexpectedly found an audience that had the need for it when I was volunteering at senior center of elderly people who had severe hand injuries. This unexpected outcome enriched my understanding of engineering: that it is a magical bridge that connects inventor’s enjoyment of exploration and user’s benefits and convenience. Growing up in a “wonderland of technology”, I was inspired to become an engineer and inventor. I loved the process of exploring the hidden ideas of my mind and figuring out how to substantiate them. My dream is to continue to use my creativity and imagination to create things that can benefit society or simply bring convenience to people’s lives.",

As I explained that the leverage was more efficient and the spoon easier to control using my way, I was called a geek. ;Besides these geeky and nerdy sides of me, I think I am more of a geek because I am really interested in gadgets; I would break apart a nail clipper to understand the mechanics, and spent years thinking about how to solve my chopstick problems, which lead to the birth of Chop-X.Maybe my knowledge is not yet in-depth enough to be a scientific geek, but I think I am on the way to become one."

    "CommonApp": "In primary school, my classmates started to call me “mommy.” At first, I was confused by the title. Other than the fact that I was taller and older than most of my peers, I viewed myself as just a typical kid. But I soon learned the nickname was a result of others recognizing my responsible nature and more adult mannerisms. Soon, I began to take a private, strange pride in the nickname, excited by the fact that others saw me as poised and mature.  ‘I have to live up to this title’, I decided. Thus, I became a model student, working extra hard for A’s in every class; a responsible citizen, I swept our classroom’s floor for twenty minutes after school; a supportive companion, I listened to my friends complain about their parents late into the night, even as I struggled to combat my drooping eyelids. I did everything I could to make myself worthy of this “crown.”My “mommy” nickname followed me to middle school. This time, however, it didn’t sound as pleasant. As my peers pursued the latest fashions and listened to Eason Chan and Britney Spears, they were often surprised to find that I, too, enjoyed listening to rock music in my spare time. They had just assumed that I listened to the Mozart and Beethoven that their parents enjoyed. I began to realize that my pursuit for poise and maturity had brought with it unexpected social stigmas and misconceptions, even from some of my closest friends. Thus, I began trying to break free of the mommy label. I joined the school softball team; I performed in the comedy show; I did everything I could in an attempt to say “ Hey guys!

    "Supps": "题目：Contemporary higher education reflects a tension between preparing for a meaningful life and preparing for a career. What are you looking for in your undergraduate education? Which emphasis is more important to you at this time and why?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          In college I’m looking for answers.Is there an ultimate meaning for the universe? And if it turns out to be “42” as proposed in the Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, what should we do?Can Brownian motion explain the principles of the universe?Does all literature on Earth have a common source, like Gilgamesh to The Iliad and The Odyssey?Are we born good or evil? Can good and evil even be a standard for judgment?Niebuhr once said, “God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.” But how can I know the difference?Is my life predetermined, or susceptible to my free will?Should I continue with the Mathematics that I’ve always been good at, or should I further my passions in religion, politics, and philosophy?In college I’m looking for friends.We can travel to Spain to visit the buildings of Gaudi and to Italy to see the fresco paintings of the confident, independent, and beautiful Etruscan women.We can freely talk about our ambitions and dreams late into the night, paying full attention to and respecting each other’s words.We can trust each other after stepping into society, knowing we always have someone to lean on.We will continue writing to and visiting each other after we achieve our life goals.In college I am looking for challengers.People who question me and drive me to grow stronger.People who stimulate my morale and keep me moving on.People who may be different from me, but from whom I can still appreciate and learn from.All of these things and people that I am looking for will not be constrained by a single career. They spread into every corner of my life, and help me grow and discover who I really am.One career, one application of what I learn from them, cannot fully represent my whole picture. Maybe I’ll follow my father’s path, studying Mathematics. Maybe I’ll be a social entrepreneur after graduation. Maybe I’ll be a cello teacher in my sixties. Attending college for me is not about one career. It is about discovering my true self, and equipping me to live a life that is meaningful, colorful, and happy. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Many human beings throughout history have found inspiration and joy in literature and works of art. Is there a book, play, poem, movie, painting, music selection, or photograph that has been especially meaningful to you?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I have grown up with “3 Idiots.” ;When I was eleven, my primary school head teacher played us the movie “3 Idiots.” The protagonist, Rancho, inspires two of his former classmates, Farhan and Maju, to chase their dreams instead of following the crowd and conforming to their parents. ;Rancho’s braveness and passion not only inspired Farhan, but also inspired me through the screen. “Pursue your dream,” I told myself, “don’t worry and go for what you want. That’s what you are born for.”At that time, I did have a fantastic new dream. I had recently started playing the cello after my mom had taken me to a Yoyo Ma concert. During the three-hour concert, I had fallen deeply in love with cello. As I played, I imagined the gorgeous, graceful sounds of Yoyo Ma’s cello coming from my cello and bow.However, I soon found achieving this fantasy difficult. For a whole year, most of the sounds coming from my cello were dull and lifeless at best. What was wrong with my dream? Did I not love it deeply enough? ;Confused, I revisited the movie. This time, I discovered something I hadn’t previously noticed: the success the three students had achieved was not only the result of a dream or fleeting passion. It required fortitude and perseverance. ;Rancho became successful because he refused to simply daydream about his goals. He even goes so far as to disguise himself, so that he can overcome his social status and get a college degree. Likewise, Farhan does not become a wildlife photographer simply by hoping his dream would come true. Rather, creates a wall of animal pictures in his home, and secretly shoots photos of them against his father’s will. To accomplish their dreams, they had to work unbelievably hard, doing things that others may have called crazy or even idiotic.In that moment, I finally understood the title of the movie and how it related to my dreams. To become great at cello, passion and inspiration would not be enough. I needed to practice a lot, a crazy amount, to achieve my goals. I need to become an idiot for my dream.Now I’ve become the first cellist in my orchestra. I’ve become more familiar with my cello, though there is still much room for improvement. Now, I have learned that a dream will forever be a dream if I didn’t fight for it."

    "CommonApp": "In primary school, my classmates started to call me “mommy.” At first, I was confused by the title. Other than the fact that I was taller and older than most of my peers, I viewed myself as just a typical kid. But I soon learned the nickname was a result of others recognizing my responsible nature and more adult mannerisms. Soon, I began to take a private, strange pride in the nickname, excited by the fact that others saw me as poised and mature.  ‘I have to live up to this title’, I decided. Thus, I became a model student, working extra hard for A’s in every class; a responsible citizen, I swept our classroom’s floor for twenty minutes after school; a supportive companion, I listened to my friends complain about their parents late into the night, even as I struggled to combat my drooping eyelids. I did everything I could to make myself worthy of this “crown.”My “mommy” nickname followed me to middle school. This time, however, it didn’t sound as pleasant. As my peers pursued the latest fashions and listened to Eason Chan and Britney Spears, they were often surprised to find that I, too, enjoyed listening to rock music in my spare time. They had just assumed that I listened to the Mozart and Beethoven that their parents enjoyed. I began to realize that my pursuit for poise and maturity had brought with it unexpected social stigmas and misconceptions, even from some of my closest friends. Thus, I began trying to break free of the mommy label. I joined the school softball team; I performed in the comedy show; I did everything I could in an attempt to say “ Hey guys! I am just the same as you!”Still “mommy” remained. Soon, the crown that I had once so proudly worn felt like an unwanted weight. I was just a young and callow adolescent, naïve and fallible. Yet whatever I did, I felt people expected me to perform with “mommy’s” perfection and maturity. I expressed my discomfort to my friends several time, but none of them took it seriously.

    "Supps": "题目：Student self-governance, which encourages student investment and initiative, is a hallmark of the U.Va. culture. In her fourth year at U.Va., Laura Nelson was inspired to create Flash Seminars, one-time classes which facilitate high-energy discussion about thought-provoking topics outside of traditional coursework. If you created a Flash Seminar, what idea would you explore and why?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          When the results of 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature came out, I was a little surprised to see the Chinese novelist, Mo Yan, as the winner. His famous work, Red Sorghum, didn’t leave much impression on me when I read it in Chinese, His language felt unnecessarily ornate, sometimes leaving his true meaning obscure and hard for me to resonate with. Confused, I investigated the official Nobel website and found that it was in fact the English translations of Mo’s novels that won the prize. As a translator for my school magazine, I know how important translation is, and that it truly can build or kill an article. I began to wonder what role did the translation play in Mo’s case?I found Red Sorghum in English and soon was filled with admiration for the translator, Howard Goldblatt, who delicately introduced more profound themes into the book. In the words of William Faulkner, it ‘appealed to our universal bones - made us laugh, cry, think, and sigh.’This revelation drove me to thinking about the critical role of translation that permeates every aspect of my life. Having an idea and presenting it to others is a translation. Acquiring information and explaining it is a translation. Debating, negotiating, and propagandizing are all translations. In my Flash Seminar, I will explore with my peers the art of translation in all of its forms. We will discover the deeper truth of translation as it relates to better understanding literature, communication and human interactions.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：College of Arts and Sciences - What work of art, music, science, mathematics, or literature has surprised, unsettled, or challenged you, and in what way?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          During our first experiment in ‘Dynamic Physics’, we observed the motion of pollen grains in a beaker of water. They moved according to Chaos Theory - completely random and unpredictable. As I continued observing, I felt a connection between the pollen and myself. From the perspective of an omnipotent giant, we humans probably seem identical to these rambling pollen grains. There is no way to know how big an influence today’s smallest decision will have on the future. Who’d have guessed that Yoyo Ma concert seven years ago would lead to a lifelong love of cello? A change in lunch plans, a stroll in the park; everything in my life may be a turning point that completely alters my future trajectory. Where am I going? What will I be? Totally unknown. ;Then, I took a second look at the pollen. This time, it looked different. Though the grains traveled randomly, there was always a limit - the water. The pollen may move an inch down or two inches up, but it could never escape the beaker. It is the same for me. I might transform into a teacher, a cellist, an ambassador, or an environmental advocate, but I will always be the girl who loves interacting with people, giving to society, and challenging the old me. My characteristics are my water: they are intrinsic and guide my every movement. My future may move according to chaos dynamics, but with my water, I can exist in harmonious equilibrium."

    "CommonApp": "My living room, with its familiar coffee table and couches perfect for curling up with a book. The orchestra room at school, with its rows of cellos and rickety stands. On the surface, the two places have little in common, yet both places give me the same warm feeling of belonging and contentment. And it is all because of a set of hammers, strings, and music’s ability to transcend time and cultures.Piano has always been a large part of my life, from peeking up at my older sister’s fingers brushing the black and white keys to mastering pieces of my own. This collection of wood and ivory represents much more than just an instrument to me. Each time I sit at a piano and indulge myself— eyes closed, fingers dancing across the keys as my body sways to the rhythms—my mind fills with memories of my passion.Attending the Jacobs School of Music Piano Academy two summers ago, I was humbled by the opportunity to keep company with sixty of the nation’s finest pianists and international students. There, refreshingly stimulating conversations revolved around favorite composers, the most difficult techniques, and different styles. There, my musical knowledge broadened as we attended daily master classes and nightly concerts featuring some of the most talented musicians worldwide. There, I understood how music really is the universal communicator. When I chatted with my friend who lived in Korea her entire life, I found that the language barrier melted away as we chatted about repertoire we had in common and how to master octaves. The practical verbal communication of words and sentences, though dominant in our everyday world, is enriched by music’s ability to allow expression of our feelings on a different level.The inspiration I found at the Piano Academy created the perfect launching point for my piano exam less than a year later. In the weeks leading to my performance, I was predominantly concerned with perfecting my technique. However, in the moments before my performance, I focused less on the testing component and more on this rare opportunity to share and communicate my music with two individuals who were as passionate about music as I am. I wanted the judges to feel the Classical Period’s elegance and refinement through my Mozart Sonata, and the idyllic water scene of my Barcarolle. Each piece resonates differently with each person, and I wanted the judges to understand my perspective from the years I spent making those pieces mine. This performance stands out in my mind as one of my best, not because of the pressure or my results, but because I left everything behind, entered my music, and simply enjoyed each note, as I have consistently ever since.Music has been one of my most enduring teachers. Being a musician has taught me about poise, stage-presence, and fully appreciating critiques. Whenever I get the results from my latest festival, it is not my place or the number of points I earned that has me waiting in anticipation. Instead, I eagerly look for what the judges took from my interpretation, and whether my perspective shined through. After years of comments, I know there are many views, often contradicting, of a single performance, each with its own merit that I take to heart. Music is a learning process that continues forever, and that is what makes this art so special to me.My love of how music adds so much color to our lives and my personal growth from studying piano has been such a defining part of my life since my childhood. Through piano, I have found contentment in a unique avenue of expression. Only more places will join my living room and the school orchestra room as I continue my journey with piano, bringing this contentment to other times and places in my life.",

Reflect on an idea or experience that has been important to your intellectual development.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          “What’s your favorite subject?”Until this past summer, I confidently answered “AP Chemistry”. While I loved contributing to Othello discussions in class, sciences and their hands-on applicability to everyday life had always been more appealing. However, the Stanford Summer Humanities Institute (SHI) welcomed me into a completely new dimension of thought.At SHI, each conversation was an intelligent exchange, whether we discussed the day’s lecture or debated the merits of public versus private schools. The boundaries of my mind rapidly expanded from the start, when we considered what fictions do to us. Despite my prolific reading, I had never considered how I genuinely care for fictional characters. Each day brought new and often conflicting concepts of how to re-enchant or draw meaning from our lives. Best of all, we could explore any topic more in-depth, culminating in a ten-page discourse.SHI was the catalyst for transforming my previous notion of humanities. I realized the humanities add another dimension of color, such as Nietzsche’s world view, to the precise world of science. Nietzsche perceived two opposing forces acting together—chaotic Dionysian forces of ugly reality and aesthetic Apollonian forces that beautify Dionysian disorder. Humanities are my enriching Apollonian force, focusing attention in new places: interactions with fictional characters, movies, book rereadings. I plan on further developing this force into a lens to view the world. Philosophy is now a favorite subject, and I will continue searching for other lenses in college as I embrace my new identity as a humanities-science hybrid.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus.

I’ve always loved reading and find it so fun to shape and manipulate the English language. Reading is definitely one of my guilty pleasures, and I’m prone to having books and miscellaneous bookmarks scattered everywhere (I promise to be neater in our dorm!).

    "CommonApp": "I put the dough in the oven, turn the timer to ten-minutes, and wait for the final product –chocolate muffins. The kitchen room looks messy: glasses and bowls scattered about and different types of ingredients everywhere. Nevertheless, I enjoy it. When I put cocoa in, I was putting another Coco – myself (my English name) –into it too. I sit in front of the oven expectantly while my father, never attracted by the scent permeating the room, is working. I started baking at eighth grade wishing to try something new. When I first invited my parents to join, they did not understand. “Why wasting three hours on meaningless activities?” They classified things by their usefulness and concluded I would not get anything from “baking-a-cake”, a typical utilitarian attitude adopted by Chinese parents. I used to spend all the time doing “meaningful things” defined by them, but that did not make me happy. I disliked being forced to play the piano for tests because, well, it was forced, or jogging at night because I couldn’t calm down. However I enjoyed baking in this cozy kitchen– the aroma of vanilla, the golden-color of butter, and the tenderness of muffin. Yet how can I pursue deliciousness full-heartedly without exploring the rationales behind recipes? The rustling sounds from the oven capture my attention: the dough begins to grow mushroom-shaped. This reminds me of odd-shaped results from experiments conducted in this kitchen that fulfilled my curiosity.  “Why should we separate yolks from egg whites before stirring?” I wondered, so I experimented. The golden mishmash danced with my egg-mixer, splashing, spinning, shining. “Looks good”, I thought, but this didn't last long. The dark-yellow mud-like paste completely destructed my anticipation with the cake failing to rise. I ate my failure as usual –unforgettably “tasty”. Later I learned that letting air permeate the materials by separating the ingredients was essential. I also wondered why use low-gluten flour but not the strong one, so I experimented. The final product was surprisingly a Chinese-style oven roll! I shared it with my parents and apparently they liked it better.  As I dug more, however, I felt off-focus. Sometimes life is simply what it is. We can’t rationalize “beautiful” or “tasty”: rationales don’t matter anymore. A faint fragrance of lotus-nuts occupies the kitchen. This is not a common smell for a muffin. I put the lotus-nuts to balance with the greasy butter inside, even though my mother disagreed. As I unintentionally baked the Chinese snack, my mother seemed to grow curious about baking experiments. After having her first baking venture, she found the process of keeping everything accurate captivating. This time she joined me. “One spoon of sugar with 30g butter.” She read recipes out loud, strictly following every instruction. “We need innovations.” but I told her. “Apple succeeded out of creativity, and an apple pie needs it, too.” Previously, inspired by the jelly-making process, I attempted to combine jelly with baking. “Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could have a jelly-cake, with several layers of different flavors?” I could not wait to try. After careful calculation and stirring, I turned on the oven. The waiting time was incredibly long and thousands of good or bad possibilities popped out in my mind. A burnt cake? An exploding oven? I had no idea. When it was finished, I fell in love with its rainbow-like appearance and mixed taste. Excited, I shared it with my parents and friends, hoping to receive some compliments. “A better way is to buy jellies from supermarket and eat them together.” My father laughed. Well, only I knew what my father had missed. It was the excitement of an idea, the anxiety of waiting, and the joy of success. Ding! A triumphant sound of the oven awakens me. I am ready to enjoy the hectic pleasure of the muffin, embracing the baking world of mine in this cozy kitchen.",
    "Supps": "题目：How have your interests and related experiences influenced the major you have selected in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences? (Please limit your response to 650 words.)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          The first thing I learned about Cornell was the word “Ithacating”, which referred to something unidentifiable falling from the sky. As a person who appreciates snowy days so much, “Ithacating” might turn into a pleasant surprise. Indeed, I expect my journey in the College of Arts and Sciences to be ithacating too. The nice yet unidentifiable future means I can explore a diversity of enjoyable fields.My interest in educational policies and schooling was first ignited during interaction with American volunteers. As a group of volunteer teachers, we came together to discuss our own education experiences. The large discrepancy between two nations’ education structures shocked me. In my view, American education seems to cultivate more creative thinking while the Chinese one favors potential researchers. One thing that is seriously lacking in the Chinese educational system is the lack of real-world engagement; there are certain drawbacks to other systems too. Recognizing the importance of education in everyone’s life, I hope to research this topic and form a better structure for future pupils. Therefore, the focus on educational policies of Cornell’s sociology department attracts me. I would like to take related courses such as Schooling and Society. Led by Professor Kendra Bischoff, I can discuss the effect of schooling on students’ personal growth, the exact field where I want to dig further. Through these courses, I expect myself to be able to identify the relationship between schooling policy and social outcomes of students from different ethnicities and socioeconomic classes. In this way, I am confident that I can design more effective educational policy that generates maximum social outcomes. Indeed, I can work as a volunteer teacher in local schools around Cornell to “test out” some of my beliefs.Another academic interest of mine is in ethics. I still remember the talk during a MUN conference regarding the legitimate rights of immigrants, when I had my first discussion about ethics.Let’s try to improve the conditions of immigrant workers since we are always cooperating with each other. I propose…Why WASTE money? Fire them and benefit our citizens.But simply dismissing them is not what a MORAL nation will do…Other delegates and I disagreed about the way to treat immigrant workers. While I justified retaining them to minimize the damage, my teammates supported the “layoff” policy. Thinking further, I became increasingly curious about ethics. How do people react to ethical dilemmas, such as should we sacrifice an innocent person to save five others? How do individual decisions vary with circumstances? Can we justify the majority rule? All these questions brought me to the field of ethics and how it affects public policy. Therefore, Cornell’s Program on Ethics and Public Life attracts me. Specific courses such as Ethics and Health Care, Ethical Theory attract me. I hope to have a close interaction with Professor Kate Manne. Her research focus on virtue ethics and the relationship between normative ethics and an agent's political circumstances perfect fits my interest. I believe she can inspire and help me to search the answers of questions I have been curious about for long.Cornell CAS represents opportunities to explore a wide range of fields and pursue my true interests with freedom. I believe the College of Arts and Sciences is definitely going to be a significant platform to actualize my ambition."

    "CommonApp": "I loathe wandering in a shopping mall not knowing what to buy; I cannot start a project without detailed planning; I feel lost entering a new week without a full calendar of responsibilities.This is likely how I have always ended up the model student, where thoroughly complete assignments and proper manners never evade my grasp, and why my parents do not worry about me, leaving me to my own decision-making. This attitude remained effective even when I arrived at Mercersburg Academy and gained recognition for my efficiency and effort. And with this affirmation, I became an even stronger believer in my principles.During the annual introductions of various spring break programs, I was drawn to the 6-day Grand Canyon trip. I remembered the photos my dad showed me from his trip eight years ago. They were indeed beautiful, and he told me it was an unforgettable experience, encouraging me to go. Without much thought, I signed up.“What the heck did I get myself into?” I grumbled as I pulled one of my legs out of the knee-deep snow, only to bury the other one even deeper. Just hours ago I was groaning about my blistered heels, but now I couldn’t even feel them. It was the third day, yet I had not washed my hair once, which was now gross and sticky enough to trap mosquitoes. I also gave up brushing my teeth since the water was freezing. At night, I slept with my socks and shoes on, so I didn’t have to put them on again, slimy and cold.As I lay there, I wondered how I let this disaster happen, recounting all the preparation I had done. I brought three pairs of socks while everyone else brought two. Knowing that there would be no place to shower, I brought shampoo so I could at least rinse my hair in the river. I even bought a pair of spikes, so I could better traverse the icy trail.Naturally, I began wondering how I could have prepared better, before realizing there’s really no way to prepare for ice water seeping in under the tent. I simply didn’t belong here, where all principle and logic went out the window.On the fourth day, as I was ready to leave this nightmare, we began our climb at 4 a.m. to Plateau Point. It was dark when we arrived, and quiet except for the incessant rush of the Colorado River. Once again, I asked myself life’s biggest question—why am I here?Though originally imperceptible in the darkness, something began to take form. The river became noticeably wild under the gentle beam of morning light, and the Colorado River began to show its sinuous shape, carrying that brightness towards us. Meanwhile, I gazed on as the sky gradually turned from purple to pink, above the gilded outlines of the mountains in the horizon, until the sun broke through with its immense energy, eradicating any remaining shadows with its vigor.At that point, I forgot about my greasy hair, my stinky shirt, and my soaked socks. The scene was magnificent, even if I had seen the same image in photos many times. There was something about being there that moment, partially dazed, filthy, and standing in wet socks, which made it so much more awe—inspiring. I could understand what my father meant now by it being an “unforgettable experience”. It wasn’t the ease and comfort of the trip, or the beautiful scenery, that he wanted me to experience. He meant for me to endure the struggles he protected me from, to appreciate the splendors of struggling through uncertainties and chaos that we cannot plan for, and shouldn’t plan for. “Don’t be afraid of breaking rules or of the unexpected. Embrace it.” He told me with a chuckle.",
    "Supps": "题目：Considering your lifetime goals, discuss how your current and future academic and extra-curricular activities might help you achieve your goals. (500 words)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          My dream is to build the ultimate robot that can go beyond the limitations of today’s robots, to build a robot that can replace all kinds of human rescue operations in extreme emergency conditions. Instead of just detecting radioactive water leaks two years too late, I believe robots of the future should be able to save victims in disasters and circumstances where human rescuers cannot access.At age 15, I proposed to study in the United States alone. In the United States, I discovered the thrill of American football; with my body covered with mud and my face covered with opponents’ sweat, I ran as fast as could with the olive-shaped ball with three 200-pound athletes chasing me. Waking up to the beautiful sunrise in my sleeping bag with no clean shirt and socks to wear, I learned to slow down and appreciate the natural beauty of the snowy valley in the Grand Canyon, before continuing my bag-packing trip across the Bright Angel Creek. Swinging the racquet as hard as I can while sprinting around the squash court, I had no idea that squash would be ‘the sport’ I was to be good at. All the risks that I took and all the explorations I made gradually became part of my life.That’s why, with no experience in robot making or even computer science, I decided to participate in Robocup Junior. Hours were spent building our robots from Lego Pieces, days writing programming code to direct the robots, weeks combing the code for errors and painstakingly correcting every one. As I dived into the world of robotics, I found out that the creating robots is a continuous process of self-improvement; I was attracted to the precise logic but inapproachability of perfection. There was always something to be improved upon. Even after my robot completed a task perfectly, I could always try to simplify the coding even more or make the hardware more efficient. I was addicted to robots, not only because it was ‘cool’ and ‘awesome’, but because of its potential implication in the future world as they are equipped to perform the most ambitious tasks.Robots can potentially do things that humans cannot. In cases of extreme emergent conditions, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, or disastrous malfunctions of nuclear power plants, humans are often left hapless and restricted by the physical nature of their bodies. ;Currently, robots are typically the alternative to humans (except for specialized monotonous tasks) because of their limited mobility and ability to problem-solve. With my study of electrical engineering, I want to contribute to building the next generation of robots, capable of performing all kinds of rescue and dangerous missions, even under extreme conditions. In addition to these responsibilities, my vision for robots in the future is one where robots have meld with many aspects of our daily lives, bringing safety and convenience to us all."

Start from measure 32 please.” The memory of practice during the first year was still horrifying. Unable to read music fast enough, I always made mistakes and there was nowhere to hide: everyone heard the wrong notes. The conductor pointed them out in front of the entire band and hummed the beats for me. He stood on his toes, leaned forward and opened his arms when it was fortissimo; relaxed and closed his eyes when it was piano.This is the most serious group in school. Every member is passionate about music and wanting to make the band better. Throughout the year, I started to familiarize myself with the band, especially during percussion section. When someone played a song on the marimba, I would pick up my sticks and started playing along with the melody on the drum set. Though being a drummer, I was also curious about timpani, vibraphone, and chime, like a little kid in a candy store. As the practice time racked up, I start to feel the other aspect of the band: caring. My role was also changing, from the new kid to the group to now the elderly who takes care of the new comers. Standing in front of the band, I am not longer bothered by the horrified practices. It is now my job to lead this band to give the best performances and play the heart felt music we always do. ;\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe the unique qualities that attract you to the specific undergraduate College or School (including preferred admission and dual degree programs) to which you are applying at the University of Michigan.

Despite the hard work, participating students are never tired of it because of their passion, which keeps them pursuing their interests, challenging themselves, and exerting their fullest commitment. I look forward to be part of this program because I believe that Ross School of Business will provide me with a global vision and analytical mindset while College of Engineering will polish my constructing and modeling expertise, helping me to further pursue my robot dream.The sensor based robot project has become my addiction and I have spent hundreds of hours in the robotics lab to establish communication between processors, to work on a robot that could identify “victims” in a maze and to find its way back to the starting point. And last summer, every afternoon after the internship in Prudential Plc in the morning, I went to the Chinese University of Hong Kong and attended lectures on value based leadership and management, and entrepreneur. These past experiences not only rich my knowledge, but also inspire me to explore further in the university.The combination of Ross and COE gives me the opportunities to pursue two things I am truly passionate about. In Ross, all sorts of competitions and programs are offered such as The Target Case Study Competition, and Undergraduate Intercollegiate Stock Pitch Competition. The variety of these business related programs will help me familiarize with the world of business and finance through applying theoretical knowledge in the real life, giving me the opportunity to learn from real world business even before my career starts. In addition, community service program such as MReach will allow me to work with younger students with their business knowledge and ideas, something that I have done in high school and wish to continue in college. Besides the intellectual and analytical, the entrepreneurial aspect of Ross also encourages me to explore the application and potential of sensor based rescue robots in the real market place. Furthermore, COE’s Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) allows me to work on research projects with other research scientists and students, giving me the chance to further develop my idea of rescue robots. Applying what I learn in both schools, I can even choose research project on financial engineering, which is what I want to pursue after college.I can’t think about anything that is better than this dual degree program. It has everything that I am looking into, and I know that if I have an opportunity to be in this program, I shouldn’t miss it."

    "CommonApp": "I come from a world that appreciates taking risks and exploring the unknown. My dad, an engineer who taught himself to become an architect, believes in the power of ‘Figuring it out yourself’. Even in elementary school, my dad would ask me to assemble the newly purchased furniture without worrying about me breaking the furniture or getting hurt in the process. He would simply leave me alone with the tools and pieces and then go watch TV. My mom, who trained in traditional Chinese medicine, but worked hard to eventually become a retinal surgeon, always encouraged me to pursue new ideas and places, supporting my participation in overseas summer exchange programs and my choice to play the rambunctious drums. My parents showed me the potential of taking risks and exploration, shaping a large part of the person I am. So at age 15, when I proposed to study in the United States alone, everyone was shocked except for my parents. I knew they were proud of me.The moment that I stepped onto the Mercersburg campus was like stepping into a whole new world. It gave me the chance to explore with independent and experimental projects. Though suffering two broken bones in the process, I discovered the thrill of American football. With my body covered with mud and my face covered with opponents’ sweat, I ran as fast as could with the olive-shaped ball with three 200-pound athletes chasing me. Waking up to the beautiful sunrise in my sleeping bag with no clean shirt and socks to wear, I learned to slow down and appreciate the natural beauty of the snowy valley in the Grand Canyon, before continuing my bag-packing trip across the Bright Angel Creek. Swinging the racquet as hard as I can while sprinting around the squash court, I had no idea that squash would be ‘the sport’ I was to be good at. All the risks that I took and all the explorations I made gradually became part of my life.With no experience in robot making or even computer science, I participated in the robot challenge, attracted to its precise logic and inapproachability of perfection. There was always something to be improved upon. Even after my robot completed a task perfectly, I could always try to simplify the coding even more or make the hardware more efficient. I was addicted to robots, not only because it was ‘cool’ and ‘awesome’, but because of its potential implication in the future world as they are equipped to perform the most ambitious tasks.My dream is to build the ultimate robot that can replace all kinds of human rescue operations in extreme emergent conditions. Instead of just detecting life signs, I believe robots of the future should be able to save victims in disasters and circumstances where human rescuers cannot access. In order to achieve this dream of mine, I intend to continue pursuing risks as they present themselves, and keep exploring the unknown for more.",
    "Supps": "题目：Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience that is important to you. What about this quality or accomplishment makes you proud and how does it relate to the person you are?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I struck the cymbals at full force with both drumsticks, concluding the performance with two powerful crashes. Even though out of breath, I left my arms raised in the air like a rock star, waiting for the audience to burst into applause and cheers. It was better than the hundreds of times I dreamed it.A month earlier, practicing the Mission: Impossible theme song for the annual Pop Concert literally seemed like an impossible mission for me. The speed of the song was too fast for my ability and the rhythm was unorthodox from other songs I have played. To make matters worse, I was also assigned a fifteen-second freestyle solo that I had no clue what to do with.Each time I arrived at my solo during practice, I would lose rhythm and mislead the entire Jazz band into an off-tempo disaster. Each time we would end with our flustered conductor yelling, “Stop!” ;Finally, when he could not tolerate the beats from my drums any longer, our conductor bluntly told me, “Philip, for the sake of the band, why don’t you just play something easy? Keep the band on the right track please. You are not on Otto’s level yet.” It was not the first time the conductor showed how much he missed Otto, the senior drummer from last year.His words stung, but became my best motivation. I started to carry a pair of drumsticks wherever I went. In class, I would rap on my desk with the sticks up until teachers arrived. On my way to the dinner hall, I would beat incessantly on the lockers. Where there were no objects, I conveniently tapped on the backs of friends on our way back to the dorms, to their annoyance. Whenever I felt the need for an audience, I ventured the dorm halls, sharing the exciting drumbeats with floor mates. Quickly, they would grow annoyed with me for playing the same beats again and again, finally chasing me back to my room, where my roommate continued to suffer. ;In my free time, I would sneak into the practice room to work on different combinations, trying to perfect my solo. Beats were all I could think of.The week before the performance, I finally came up with my idea of the perfect solo. Drawing inspiration (and courage) from countless ten-minute Travis Barker solos on YouTube, I devised an ambitious piece at twice the rhythm of the rest of the song. It was the kind of solo that would awe the crowd with a fury of drumbeats while melding smoothly with the entire band’s rhythm.“That was the best live solo I have heard. Otto will be proud of you.” The conductor told me after the performance. ;I smiled, finally. Not only because I have met his expectations, but because my tireless practice has enabled me to play a memorable piece of music for the audience."

This attitude remained effective even when I arrived at Mercersburg Academy and gained recognition for my efficiency and effort. And with this affirmation, I became an even stronger believer in my principles.During the annual introductions of various spring break programs, I was drawn to the 6-day Grand Canyon trip. I remembered the photos my dad showed me from his trip eight years ago. They were indeed beautiful, and he told me it was an unforgettable experience, encouraging me to go. Without much thought, I signed up.“What the heck did I get myself into?” I grumbled as I pulled one of my legs out of the knee-deep snow, only to bury the other one even deeper. Just hours ago I was groaning about my blistered heels, but now I couldn’t even feel them. It was the third day, yet I had not washed my hair once, which was now gross and sticky enough to trap mosquitoes. I also gave up brushing my teeth since the water was freezing. At night, I slept with my socks and shoes on, so I didn’t have to put them on again, slimy and cold.As I lay there, I wondered how I let this disaster happen, recounting all the preparation I had done. I brought three pairs of socks while everyone else brought two. Knowing that there would be no place to shower, I brought shampoo so I could at least rinse my hair in the river. I even bought a pair of spikes, so I could better traverse the icy trail.Naturally, I began wondering how I could have prepared better, before realizing there’s really no way to prepare for ice water seeping in under the tent. I simply didn’t belong here, where all principle and logic went out the window.On the fourth day, as I was ready to leave this nightmare, we began our climb at 4 a.m. to Plateau Point. It was dark when we arrived, and quiet except for the incessant rush of the Colorado River. Once again, I asked myself life’s biggest question—why am I here?Though originally imperceptible in the darkness, something began to take form. The river became noticeably wild under the gentle beam of morning light, and the Colorado River began to show its sinuous shape, carrying that brightness towards us. Meanwhile, I gazed on as the sky gradually turned from purple to pink, above the gilded outlines of the mountains in the horizon, until the sun broke through with its immense energy, eradicating any remaining shadows with its vigor.At that point, I forgot about my greasy hair, my stinky shirt, and my soaked socks. The scene was magnificent, even if I had seen the same image in photos many times. There was something about being there that moment, partially dazed, filthy, and standing in wet socks, which made it so much more awe—inspiring. I could understand what my father meant now by it being an “unforgettable experience”. It wasn’t the ease and comfort of the trip, or the beautiful scenery, that he wanted me to experience.

The interest turned to passion during the stretch of hundreds of hours I spent in the lab, establishing communication between processors so they could effectively identify \"victims\" in a simulated maze.I spent this past summer in Eindhoven for the international RoboCup competition, where robots were pitted against each other in soccer matches, and trialed in simulated disasters. Although I didn’t walk away with a trophy, I left with a realization of the underexplored potential of robotics in real-life operations. Many robots in the professional league could conquer the hostile simulated environment, identify make-believe victims, and lift them to safety, while the reality was that they were not even close to ready for real-life situations. They are supposedly the ideal alternatives to humans, but the technologies are too far behind to be effectively utilized. ;This is how my interests in Electrical and Computer Engineering emerged. At CMU’s CIT, I am excited to see that the ECE curriculum covers areas in communications, computing and networking, and data analysis. In addition, with the opportunity to minor in robotics under the Robotics Institute, I look forward to be part of projects like CMU Highly Intelligent Mobile Platform (CHIMP) in the National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC). ;The study of engineering has become more than just creating the most advanced technology. Traditional textbooks are replaced with tablets to make learning more efficient, and affordable Chromebooks are helping students in the poor areas to gain Internet access. To become a resourceful engineer, I need to go into the real world and study the challenge the non-engineers are facing. Through CMU’s Technology Consulting in the Global Community (TCinGC), I will have the opportunity to work with NGOs and schools in developing and under-resourced communities, contributing to the development of sustainable uses for information and communications technology.I am also considering supplementing my engineering plans with economics through a business minor for engineering offered by Tepper School of Business. Through my high school’s SpringBoard course in “Applied Economics” (where I created a business plan for my sushi restaurant) and my summer internships, I realized how knowledge in economics could complement other subjects. Applied science can help boost business efficiency just as businesses can effectively spread technology. From the business standpoint, I can learn to evaluate rescue robots’ technical feasibility and their commercial potential through the course “70-371 Production and Operations Management”. Additionally, student organizations like Business Technology Club (BTC) will provide me opportunities to apply technology as solutions to business problems, discovering relationships between technology and modern businesses.CMU’s combination of technological expertise, opportunity for application and chances to spread engineering around the world is the reason I am attracted to the school."

At the same time, my friends have also called me an overenthusiastic geek, when once during our preparation for the robotics competition, I stopped in the middle of my shower and entered my teammates’ room to discuss improvements for our robot. ;And it is not unusual during our disagreements for me to adamantly remain in his room, lying on his sofa with my feet on his desk, while treating myself to one of his precious coffees until I have convinced him.It is hard to categorize myself as a geek or a nerd, but with a logical mind and determination to persuade, I think it is safe to say I will fit in fine with either, along with everything else in between.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Describe your academic interests and how you plan to pursue them at USC.

Taking the robotics class in my high school, I was attracted to its precise logic and inapproachability of perfection. There was always something to be improved upon. Even after my robot completed a task perfectly, I could always try to simplify the coding or make the hardware more efficient. I never felt tired of robots, spending hundreds of hours in the lab to establish communication between processors, to work on a robot that could identify “victims” in a maze and to find its way back to the starting point. Therefore, in college, I want to further pursue my passion in robots.I want to explore both Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering from Viterbi before deciding on one. I was pleased to find out the wide range of robotics related courses offered in the Computer Science Department. Course such as “Sensing and Planning in Robotics” will enrich me with the applications to problems in robot mapping, perception and manipulation, polishing my constructing and modeling expertise. Moreover, the cross-lab projects and the interdisciplinary research opportunities like “Active NAO!” from the Center for Robotics and Embedded System (CRES) at the Viterbi School of Engineering will let me gain a better understanding of different research areas, from nanorobotics to humanoids, helping me to build the next generation of rescue robots with the capability to replace human in extreme rescue missions."

    "CommonApp": "“Perfect! Perfect! I want to speak perfect English!” Behind the curtains of the grand stage, I recited my speech for the last time, closely observing my competitors do the same. “Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent…” Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address.“I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons...will be able to sit down together...” Martin Luther King. “Never, never, never – in nothing, great or small, large or petty - never give in...” I found myself repeating after Churchill’s all too familiar style. “Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.” It looked like everyone had chosen speeches as famous as their original orators. Meanwhile I looked over my speech, condensed onto 4 pages of notes, entitled “English Mania”. The original speaker was Jay Walker, maybe best known as founder of priceline.com, but certainly no revolutionary. Churchill reassured me though: Never give in.Indeed, I was nervous being the only foreigner, competing in the grand finals against my talented American classmates.As I calmed myself down, the host announced, “Let us welcome junior Minghuan Noah Liu!” I stepped into the spotlight, my pounding heartbeats drowning out the audience.“Let’s talk about manias. Let’s start with Beatles mania, hysterical teenagers, crying, screaming, pandemonium. Sports mania: deafening crowds, all for one idea—get the ball in the net…” My hands were shaking, so I amplified my hand gestures to hide it. “I want to speak perfect English!”Again.“I wang-to, se-bi-ke, per-fei-k-t, Ying-ge-li-sh!” I repeated with a thick Chinese accent, mimicking Walker’s original audience.“Hahahaha!” The crowd erupted in laughter, and I could hear my best friend Alex laugh the loudest, since it was his thick Chinese accent that I impersonated.“So let us experience the passion of Chinese students’ learning English again! Perfect!” “Per-fei-k-t!”“Perfect!”“Per-fei-k-t!”I bellowed each word while my fingers pointed at the invisible but omnipresent stigmas. I recalled my purpose: to expose the reality of Chinese students.“Imagine a student taking a giant test for 3 days. Her score on this one test literally determines her future. She studies 12 hours a day for three years to prepare. And 25 percent of her grade is based on English.”Really, imagine it, Chinese students who devote as much time studying English, as a typical American student would spend on an entire day’s assignments. Yes, it is hard to deny that we are quiet and nerdy, who indeed study day and night.“That’s why this year China will become the world’s largest English-speaking country!” Everyone laughed again.But the truth is, Chinese students abhor studying as much as any other teenager. There is just no other choice.“Why English? In a single word: Opportunity. Opportunity for a better life, a job, to be able to pay for school, or put better food on the table.” The audience suddenly calmed. There is reason why Chinese students are “good at math”, “hard studiers”, and ever “soft-spoken”. They are constrained to these molds in a society that gives no second chances for those who don’t fit in the rigid system, because besides the strict path, there are no other paths—no other future. That is why they strive each day, so they don’t get left behind in a country prospering from globalization. “Like the harnessing of electricity in our cities or the fall of the Berlin Wall, English represents hope for a better future—a future where the world has its common language to solve its common problems.”With increasing number of students studying abroad, we are still just a handful chosen by chance—who do not give a full representation of the millions who continue to study and persevere daily so they can live a more respected life they deserve.",

Nevertheless, the most important thing I believe that makes me a good prefect is not my passion or enthusiasm toward my job; instead, it was responsibility. Since I know that my job was my responsibility, and if I did not finish the job well, many other people will be evolved as well, and the whole process will be slowed down. Therefore, no matter how tired I was or how much other work I have, I always finish my task nicely on time since I knew that it was my duty. ;At Oxford College, I want to participate in the Leadership Oxford program to further enhance my leadership skills in the diverse environment of Emory during my third and fourth years and possibly share my experience on public speaking with other future leaders.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Tell us something you didn't share in your admission application.

One day, when I asked them about their dream, many told me they did not have one and the rest told me “I want to earn big money.”I was devastated by their answers, so I prepared a speech to share my experience in the US. I talked about how I was able to realize my dream of helping Americans to better understand Chinese through a speech contest, and the successful stories of Bill Gates and Walt Disney. I wanted to teach them that money should not be the only driving force in pursuing their dreams.I have always thought that poverty still exists in many areas of China was because of lack of funding and support. Actually, the lack of dream was the most serious problem these children face. What they need is inspiration, not money. So this upcoming summer, I am going to go there again.

More than 25% of the time can be used for elective courses, which I look to take advantage of studying music (the history of rock and roll), communication (to learn how to present my idea in a way that can resonate with others), psychology (to learn about the reason behind human behavior), and drawing (to give myself a time for relaxing)."

    "CommonApp": "I had been waiting outside the court for like a century. Beautiful music echoing in the ballroom and professional dancers dancing elegantly and passionately, I could not enjoy all but felt so nervous that my palms had already been sweated. Here was I in the CBDF (China Ballroom Dance Federation), a national dancing competition, competing with girls and boys from professional dancing schools.  Gradually, familiar tune and graceful movements eased my stress and my mind flew back to the year when I first met Latin. John Dryden once said, dancing is the poetry of the foot. I fell in love with this kind of poetry five years ago. First at school club, then I went to the amateur dancing club for more professional training, and soon I was transferred from standard classes to advanced ones. I never thought of quitting until my favorite partner―a boy who used to be my idol―came to me and said, “Maggie, I’ve decided to quit dancing.” I was shocked. He was very talented in dancing, and I admired his speed and movements for a long time and wished to dance like him someday. Then, he told me the reason, “I was too busy with my schoolwork and was hard pressed to prepare the exams. Of course I love dancing, but study is more important.” With a sorry look, he gave a deep sigh. “You should also consider about it, Maggie. You are about to prepare for the high school entrance examinations and you don’t want to ruin it, do you?” He said sincerely, looking into my eyes. How can a person give up his love just because of study and examinations? I recalled those pictures in which my figure was reflected in the mirror with solitude beauty, and I remembered those days when I came to the club regardless of weather and illness. I danced, leaving all my troubles behind; I danced, like an ugly duckling finally grew to a grace swan; I danced, as if I were the best dancer in the world. Without dancing, I would not have been who I am now.At that moment, I knew my answer. So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, so long lives my love for dance. To balance study and dance is not easy. I have recited English words while taking a rest in the dance training, and have practiced artistic movements while being troubled by difficult math questions. With diligence and perseverance, I was admitted by my dream high school, and got the chance to take part in CBDF as a real dancer as well. Finally, the very day came. Seeing the competitive dancers who were all older than me, I was almost suffocated with stress. However, as the moment I stepped on the stage, there was nothing in my mind but dance.",

I don’t think I had any idea about environmental protection at that age, though I just didn’t like wasting. ;My desire to study environment was first aroused when I knew Roots and Shoots, an international environmental organization established by Jane Goodall in 1991. I became aware of it when I read a comic in a magazine at Grade 3, and I was totally moved by Jane’s story and was curious about this organization. The first opportunity of getting close to it came with an extracurricular class of Roots and Shoots in my middle school. During this class, we collected the recycle boxes in every office and assorted them. This activity lasted for a year, impressing me with the significance of environmental protection and inspiring my passion for environment-related activities. ;My knowledge about environment increased as I became a formal member of Roots and Shoots in high school. Its environmental activities were much more complex than those in middle school. We communicated with companies, examined whether their offices were eco-friendly enough, and then wrote reports about improvements and suggestions. Moreover, we did presentations to workers, telling them how to be eco-friendly in daily lives. ;My desire to make the earth greener grew stronger; however, I couldn’t help noticing local environment was getting worse – the excessive emission of greenhouse gases, the waste of food and energy, etc. I have to do something to make a difference.As I became the leader of Shoots and Roots, I spared no effort to promote my program called “Go Vegan, Go Green”, which aimed to make people be aware of the relationship between vegetarianism and environmental protection. It was a piece of hard work all the while. At first many people misunderstood it as a program asking people to become vegetarians. Some even doubted its value. However, my group and I never lost heart. We gave kids interesting lessons on vegetables, made exhibition boards and interactive activities to publicize our idea, and established relative software for adults. I was so glad that with our perseverance, people started to accept our opinion. ;There is a Chinese saying, “don’t fail to do something good even if it’s trivial, and don’t engage in anything bad even if it’s tiny”. Picking up a piece of litter or throwing it away, the choice is up to you. Becoming a member of Roots and Shoots and participating in so many environmental protection activities helped me realize the way my life should be and encouraged me to find my life value. I determine to study environment science, a field offers me passion and significance. Though my power may be tiny, my belief is firm. ;"

This cavern might be rather amusing to wander leisurely on a weekend, but I was alone and tired, as midnight approached.Dead-end. An old, shutdown exit.All my patience vanished as I stood there, letting anxiety and frustration accumulate in its place.

My youth seems bounded by limits.I recalled the endless dialogues before each “Club Day” performance. The age divide between teachers and students created equally divided opinions on artistic beauty. Conflicts rarely came singly and far outnumbered compromises. My role with Student Association Union placed me in the center of it all, giving rise to visions of harmony that hopelessly remained visions.

Media became more than “just about me” when I was a news anchor in the school media center, permeating students’ daily conversations with my voices. Media brings people together through commonalities found in shared ideas. The constant surprises brought by media trigger my passion for it and Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism will offer me many opportunities to explore of the world of media.Browsing through Annenberg’s site, I was attracted by it flexibility in allowing students to choose their own area of focus. Besides offering fundamental theory-basis courses, Annenberg provides undergraduates many hand-on opportunities such as finding the most creative and artistic solutions for “cool problems” about media and analyzing innovation’s impact on culture in Innovative Lab. I am especially attracted by the International Communication Study program. The opportunity to experience diversity and similarity of the media practice in Europe will help me to integrate my Chinese background with American and European visions and to understanding media on a global scale.Reading the Annenberg Student Spotlight page was like reading my own dairy: ambitious, proud, excited about what we have done and passionate about the potential in the future. With all the possibilities in Annenberg, I know I will be able to complete my definition of media."

    "Supps": "题目：1. Given your NYU campuses of interest - whether they are your primary and alternate home campuses of interest or where you would like to study away while you are a student - where, exactly, would you like to study at NYU - and why? 2. Whether you are undecided or you have a definitive plan of study in mind, what are your academic interests and how do you plan to explore them at NYU? (500 words limit combined)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          My vision of New York starts from 30 Rockefeller Plaza. ;“Live from New York, it is Saturday night!” The boisterous line is opening up to another utopia for me—Saturday Night Live. I did not get it the first time Seth Meyer made the comment during the Weekend Update, but the infectious laughter from the audience compelled me to research into politics for the first time in my life. Indeed, the electorate can be as funny as he made it seem.As I become more immersed, I realize that politics is just a tip of the SNL iceberg. It is the world in ninety minutes. I began regularly pausing every three minutes to voraciously cram culture trends, global affairs, and even celebrity gossip, so I could laugh along when Miley Cyrus announced that Hannah Montana was murdered. SNL showed me that New York is a place where everything matters, because everything belongs here, the epitome of globalization. However, New York City is just one reason why NYU is a paradise for media learners like me.My involvement with NYU begins at the Global Scholars Program at Steinhardt, where I am grappling with the variety of media practices amongst various countries and cultures. It is where I spend my first year, developing a foundation in media through courses in Global and Transcultural Communication, and Tisch, where I will have on-set opportunities to work with film and television production teams. The MCC study in NYU penetrates everything, endowing me with an overall grasp of media.The following spring, I am in Paris—and in broader extent, Europe—accessing courses in arts and culture in Europe, while taking advantage of traveling to neighboring countries, as I make better sense of the womb of the Renaissance. I learn what self-expression truly means, subjecting myself to the non-conforming spirit of Europe. Gradually, I am capable of finding not only my own voice, but also the genuine voices within others, helping them express themselvs, like Dante did in his astonishing grasp of societal struggles in Divine Comedy.My next destination is a temporary trip home to China. The rapid development of media in China means there are plenty of areas for improvement. Through the course in MCC and Interactive Technology and Media in NYU Shanghai, I familiarize myself with the Avant-guard media science being tested and applied. I make the most of my time by interning part-time at an advertising company near Huangpu River, where I am applying my knowledge to designs that will most effectively communicate ideas. The process realizes my accumulated knowledge, putting it into a concrete and persuasive form.When my exploration concludes in New York, I will be a global media apprentice, integrating my personal influences with visions from various parts of the world. Amongst my NYU fellows, I listen to their voices, and participate in media production to put culturally significant ideas on stage, further expanding the prospering diversity of NYU. And I am only getting started."

This cavern might be rather amusing to wander leisurely on a weekend, but I was alone and tired, as midnight approached.Dead-end. An old, shutdown exit.All my patience vanished as I stood there, letting anxiety and frustration accumulate in its place. Under the faint incandescent light, I stared hopelessly at the deathly ashen roadblock. Sweat formed in my grip. The limitation was suffocating.‘We are all limited. Know where your limit is, and never cross it.’ Somehow that moment, the remark from my TOEFL teacher crossed my mind.‘Another limit, huh?’ I scoffed. My youth seems bounded by limits.I recalled the endless dialogues before each “Club Day” performance. The age divide between teachers and students created equally divided opinions on artistic beauty. Conflicts rarely came singly and far outnumbered compromises. My role with Student Association Union placed me in the center of it all, giving rise to visions of harmony that hopelessly remained visions. I sighed, I cried, and I sulked, but in the end I realized my goals were far beyond my limits.I recalled the furious vetoes I put on the personal statement ideas I originally conceived. I wanted to create something touching, heart-stirring even, like the last scene in Silver Linings Playbook when Bradley Cooper makes the right decision; yet every attempt turned out pathetically phony. I became irritated, sensitive, and eventually admitted that the essay I dreamed of was beyond reach.Wrong direction again.Turning around, I noticed the commercial of a famous iced tea campaign with teenagers gathered singing and dancing. At the end, they all take a sip and shout: ‘YOUTH IS UNLIMITED!’ I found it rather misleading—of course youth is limited, like any other age brackets in life.The rejections from my crush set clear boundaries on who I could date. The barely-acceptable grades on my dedicated physics project demonstrated the extents of subjects I could master. The fatigue from my 15-minute morning run signaled my physical limits.Too many times I have approached unfamiliar matters bolstering with confidence, only to be overwhelmed, like a moth consumed by the beautiful flames it boldly embraced, unaware of its own trivial presence—it's fatal and no good.Sure, we all have dreams to realize, but in reality, we usually just aren’t quite there—limited. My teacher was right in that sense.I encountered the same crossroad I passed earlier. I took a deep breath, and took an obscure route.But after recounting all the incidents, so what? Actually, he was half right—we all indeed have limits, but ‘never cross it’? That seems unconscionable because that would be neglecting my gains in spite of failure, even if they don’t meet our expectations. If I had not tried my best the first time to settle the conflicts in SAU, I wouldn’t have done better the next time. If I never courted my teenage crush, I would have never discovered the subtle art of romance. Even Abraham Lincoln himself was known for his numerous failures that culminated into his inspiring leadership.I believe limits exist for all of us, but our ‘irrational’ boldness is what stretches these limits. Each time I defy my limits, I know them better, so I can push even harder next time as I edge towards becoming the person I want to be.The anxiety subsided, the shackles on patience were removed. ‘EXIT’, read the sign on the wall. I rushed it like a caveman discovering the light he had been searching for. Liberated.",
    "Supps": "题目：We are a community with quirks, both in language (we’ll welcome you to Grounds, not campus) and in traditions. Describe one of your quirks and why it is part of who you are.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Shenzhen is one of the few cities that strictly mandates student dress code—all the students in the city wear the same kind of uniform: blue polo for the boys, white polo for the girls, and dark trousers for all. The design itself is dull, exacerbated by the humdrum of monotony five days a week—like the Oompa-loompas in Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. Depressing.That is why I never wear my uniform properly, rolling up my trousers’ leg like a vagabond, soliciting penned artwork from my classmates to be immortalized on the white neckline, and inscribing “EXCELSIOR” on the back of the jacket to declare my pursuance towards excellence. My friends laugh and call me “quirky”, but I take it as a compliment.There is a reason for this quirkiness. Difference is what makes the world so bewilderingly beautiful. It is through distinctness that we begin to identify art, and allows us tell apart the intricate cultures of civilizations. What contributes to this difference is creativity, and those who adeptly utilize it. I might not become a great ruler in the future, but I can surely leave my legacy as an artistic non-conformist within my established community. I am not a troublemaker but a trend leader; I am the one whose quirkiness stands out among the flood of blue and white, that has gradually become my signature. “That’s Leo”, they say, pointing at the one with the inside-out school jacket.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What work of art, music, science, mathematics, or literature has surprised, unsettled, or challenged you, and in what way?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          If I tell the world that Saturday Night Live unsettles me, they will probably laugh; but this is the power of SNL—to make viewers laugh, and leave them unsettled.Living in China, I can only develop a narrow interest in politics. It was some serious subject that serious people talk about on serious TV channels like CCTV—certainly much too serious to have anything to do with me. Then one time, I found Seth Meyer in Weekend Update, making sarcastic commentary on the electorate that I did not get. But, the laughter from the audience was so contagious that it compelled me to Google related news and background information. It was a shock to me that the president was not chosen by majority vote, but through the complex electoral system. The ten-minute clip was far more effective than the countless evening CCTV I grew up with.Politics was just a tip of the gigantic SNL iceberg. I began to voraciously scour the Internet on culture trends, global affairs, and even celebrity gossip, so I could laugh along when Miley Cyrus announced that Hannah Montana was murdered. By the end of the day, why the U.S. government shut down itself may have nothing to do with me, but it is everything I am eager to learn about. ;Humor is an art with an incredible ability to incite curiosity and desire to understand things across cultures and borders—even things occurring on the insipid CCTV. SNL unsettles me, in turn expanding my desire for knowledge."

    "CommonApp": "Endless ripples of faces flow amid a deep-sea of blue and white, a typical sight of Friday rush hour. They are thousands of students in identical uniforms—strictly mandated and enforced since the early 90’s.But we are not like Oompa-loompas from Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory, subject to indistinguishable uniformity. Underneath the outwardly dismal monotony, there are ruses—trade secrets amongst artists craving for individuality like a desert rogue craving water. A pair of trousers is seen subtly rolled like those of workers in an old Ford factory, a decorated neckline etched with comic characters catches the eye, and inscribed on the back of my own jacket in bold ink, is my favorite slogan, “EXCELSIOR”, signifying my pursuance of excellence.Growing up in this non-conforming community, I inherited a strong desire to showcase my own uniqueness—to be a standout and innovative artist amongst my peers. In kindergarten I occupied the entire blackboard with my comic strip to retell (in colorful rendition) the story of the raven that brilliantly satisfied its thirst from a deep pitcher. Seventh grade was when I supplemented a boisterous Queen anthem to the end of a classic Chinese play, where soldiers were returning in triumph. The group project I directed garnered loud applauses from the classroom and judge teachers with its unconventional infectiousness. Each of these inspirations triggered a release of dopamine, and I became addicted.It was this same thrill boiling in my vein when I formed the idea behind Shenzhen School Uniform, a short film I co-directed in memory of the community I live in, by intertwining a selection of stories instead of following the traditional short-film formats with their singular plot line. With a belief that the best way to represent youth was through youth itself, we began gathering (and piecing) diverse stories from the students around us, to showcase the vibrant student culture we were all so proud of. At last, our project found unexpected audiences from all over the country, and earned us a short-film award, attesting to my commitment and beliefs.Shenzhen School Uniform is not only a depiction of the world I come from, but also a reflection of my non-conforming ideals the world had instructed. I am told that being outside the box itself is a work of art, a self-expression that I will keep on telling in forms other than a video, as I broaden my understanding of life in another country, another world.",
    "Supps": "题目：Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience that is important to you.

Darkness. 4 a.m. at Shenzhen Foreign Language School. By the faint snore of my roommates, I start my school day.High school at first bewildered me with various hands-on activities within the campus. I wanted to enhance my athletic skills on the tennis team, establish my own project to arrange student volunteer interpreters for the Shenzhen Museum, and be on time for every live broadcasting of daily news to the entire campus. Naturally, my passion outside the classroom affected my performance inside, and as a result, I failed my first exam in Shenzhen Foreign Language School.Instead of giving up the activities though, I decided I would wake up three hours earlier each day, at 4 a.m., to study. I would be caught dozing during Mr. Jiang’s music class and sometimes spoke in nonsense with my friends, but I was too determined to give up.It worked. On the first mid-term I ranked twenty out of nine hundred students while successfully leading my activities. Soon after, the praise began to fall. One teacher told my story to her class as demonstration of exemplary hard work; at a general assembly, I was asked to give a speech in front of the entire Senior One class about time management; “Early riser” became my nickname. ;Additionally, I was proud of being recognized by teachers and students on my way to lunch. I relished in their admiration, and how they considered me a “legend”. Even on days when I didn’t have to, I still woke up early in case I was asked, “When did you wake up today?”After some time when the praise diminished, I began hearing different opinions beneath the encouragements: “He is insane”, “He doesn’t have a life”, “I rank ahead of him even though I wake up at seven”. The voices of complete strangers affected me, and “Riser-at-four” had become my unwanted label, a mark of my incompetence that I was eager to shed.I decided to “quit” rising early, despite being unsure of how it would affect the balance I took so long to establish.My volunteer program was cut by the end of the semester because I failed to send capable student volunteers to the museum, and I messed up my responsibilities as an organizer for a large performance due to the negligence of a key procedure in backstage. Sitting in the classroom alone after school, I realized I let a “label” get to me too easily. I let opinions of strangers impact the decisions I made.To wake up at four was a choice I made for myself, along with my decision to pursue media, or to prefer Coke over Pepsi. They should be neither a source of pride nor shame, for they simply shape who I am.One thing is for sure—there will always be judgments alongside our choices, but the independent soul takes neither support nor criticism too seriously. Praise should not form into pride, just as criticisms should not carve cowardliness. The next day I woke up at four again. I opened my eyes amid the darkness, on my way back to action."

    "CommonApp": "If insanity is as Albert Einstein defined it, “doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result,” then I’m insane, or at least I was for the longest time. I participate in hackathons, daylong programming hubs where people of similar passions can come together to create original applications in hardware or software. At every event, my inventiveness and mental faculties are delightfully challenged. With only twenty-four hours to turn my ideas into something tangible, I often find it difficult to complete my projects. Yet despite failing to finish multiple times, I continue to return because these events are more than mere outlets for my creative expression.It started two years ago at a hackNY hackathon—a gathering of undergraduate developers, designers, and entrepreneurs. After I was advised to \"build something you need,\" I remembered being home alone and having to scour the Internet for food recipes, only to find listed ingredients that I didn’t have. So I created QuickBite—an app I needed—which could search a database using one’s available ingredients and return feasible recipes. Twenty­four hours passed, but I was unable to finish or present my work. An air of defeat surrounded me that day, but not without an overwhelming sense of inspiration invoked by my love for creating.Four hackathons passed in kind. Each time, I drew from my needs and experiences to form my applications: ForeSpeak, to help me learn foreign languages; Gamelify, to keep track of my online games; SportTrack, to log my sports networks; and Moov, to let me more easily invite friends to watch movies. But I could never finish within the twenty-four hours given. Every time, I learned from my mistakes; I’d build on the knowledge and foundation of my previous works. But the time constraint would continually defeat me.Within months of the last, I registered for another hackathon, Hack the Change, at the University of Pennsylvania. This one was different; it focused on assisting the international community and creating the change we wished to see in the world. Having read of the failing pharmaceutical system in Botswana, I designed a mobile app that could help the nation's people locate the medicine they need. Throughout the night my fingers danced until the twenty-fifth hour rang, the hacking ended, and I had finished. In cheery disbelief, I tested my application over and over again, and it worked every time.Moments later, students funneled into a lounge, eager to reveal the products of their restless labor. Having never completed in time before, I watched intently as each group presented, until I was called up. On stage, I paused and looked around. I wanted to be here; I chose to keep coming back; I realized that using items that could fit in a backpack, anyone—myself included—could make an impact on the world. I took a deep breath, andbegan, “Every day, thousands of people in Botswana are forced to live with untreated, life­ threatening medical conditions because they can’t find the pharmaceuticals they need...” I had finally been able to finish one of my projects—and I knew why.Every app I had built before, was built for me. I conceived them from my experiences and tailored them to my needs. But this time was different. This time I was building to improve the lives of people I didn’t know. Taking into consideration the needs of others, even those of strangers, entailed a sense of purpose that motivated, that compelled me to finish. I realized that every application I had created—recipe finder, sports tracker, or movie inviter—could touch the lives of many, and that I’m never only building for myself. Am I insane? Others might think so; after all, I willingly stay up for twenty-four hours. But I don't believe I am, because hackathons don’t just offer me an outlet to express myself, they give me purpose—building for that impact I can have on others.",

(250 word limit.)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Whenever I love what I do, there’s nothing that can stop me from doing it. After watching the main character of C huck hack and code his way out of impossible scenarios, I was inspired to become a programmer. I watched YouTube tutorials on coding and I fell in love with what I now consider, an art. Everything I’ve learned as a budding programmer stems from informal origins—the books in my room and the lectures saved on my computer.Entering high school, I was disappointed to find that my school didn’t offer any computer science courses, but I continued to code anyway. Throughout the year, I had to juggle my schoolwork with my programming projects, which always kept me occupied. Towards the end of tenth grade, I decided to take the AP Computer Science A exam after working through Stanford’s SEE course in Programming Methodology—and I’d like to thank Mehran Sahami for being the greatest teacher I never knew.Computer science has taught me to think differently; it has given me the ability to bring my ideas to life and to budget my time. I’ve been able to expand my creative horizons and put my knowledge to use at hackathons—often for the benefit of others. Despite never taking a formal course in computer science, I’ve been able to learn and grow more than I could’ve ever imagined. I’ve realized that I should never wait for the proper guidance to present itself, because I can always seek out the resources I need.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate ­­ and us ­­ know you better. (250 word limit.)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Greetings, fellow ProFro!First off, I’m always happy and energetic—you’ll most likely realize this upon first sight. I’m never a stranger and always an adventurer. I hope you’ll join me in trying new foods (if it smells bad, it could be delicious), exploring places (the city via Caltrain) and debating whether Batman or Ironman would win in a fight (heads up, I’m a proponent of Ironman). Being optimistic, I’m always here to cheer you up with nerdy humor should you find yourself down—forgive me if I sound like the Big Bang Theory at times.If you ever see me jumping around campus like a spider monkey, don’t be alarmed, I’m not possessed; it’s a passion of mine called freerunning. You’ll likely see me engaging in this seemingly deranged behavior if I have to get somewhere—fast. Despite being active, I love to sleep which, coming from New York, might surprise you. But wake­ups won’t be an issue as I’m a morning runner and hope that you’ll join me. If running isn't your thing, I’d love to grab a cup at the CoHo.I love learning—humanities, cultures, sciences, people—so you’ll often find me in the Green Library; not only during Dead Week. You’ll also see me typing away at my computer at times but feel free to interrupt me; I’m serious. I’ll most likely be working on some app I thought of in the shower and would love to tell you all about it. I can’t wait to meet my lifelong friend.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What matters to you, and why? (250 word limit.)\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Should you focus more on the problem, or the solution? Though many would pick the solution—undoubtedly believing it would solve the former—I prefer to concentrate on the problem. I’ve learned from programming that it’s more important to know why you’re building, than to know what you’re building. Looking at a problem from different perspectives gives me a better understanding of what I’m trying to solve. Only then, can I find the best solution.At Facebook’s NY hackathon, I worked on a mobile app that could let me more easily bring my friends together to watch movies—no more mass texting. But that night, I lost track of the problem at hand and was unable to finish. I added non­essential features like a movie rating system even though the primary focus was on inviting friends via Facebook. Ever since, I’ve adopted a problem­ oriented focus so I can always keep in mind the true problem.The concepts I’ve learned from programming aren’t just applied to my work—they’re applied to the way I deal with personal issues. During sophomore year, I wasn’t performing as well I should’ve been; tests became difficult and homework grew demanding. The immediate thought that came to mind was to work harder. But after examining the problem—and realizing that a cycle of sleep deprivation and inattentiveness was the true cause—I arrived at a very different solution: to relax more. Never again, did I have the same issue. For me, fully understanding the problems is more important than finding the solutions."

    "CommonApp": "On most nights, the stars to me look like fluffy bunnies, and the moon like a giant marshmallow. My astigmatism isn't debilitating--I think I look classy in glasses. In fact, my problematic vision is probably one reason I'm interested in how machines and people can work together to help us see the world.I've been fascinated with computer vision since 9th grade, when I developed software to recognize traffic lights and warn distracted drivers. The following year, I created an algorithm that recognized a walking person and generated useful gait data for doctors. While scouring scientific journals that same year, I discovered that doctors were trying to marry computer analysis with human intuition to see into human tissue biopsies to diagnose cancer. At least, that was the idea.Reality was a bit different. Pathologists reading biopsy slides must deal with billions of pixels of raw data. Interpretation isn't black and white: what one pathologist sees as a 3+4 Grade cancer, another may regard as a 4+3 Grade cancer. Those diagnoses are vastly different, so precision and objectivity are vital. So is speed; pathology labs must rifle through thousands of slides. Computers are good at these tasks, but they are not so great at others--recognizing faces, for instance. It's surprisingly difficult to write algorithms for most of the things humans do without thinking.What if I trained an algorithm to quickly differentiate between these two prostate cancers--to think like a person distinguishing the face of a friend from a stranger? I needed lots of slide images to start working, but even after 40+ pleading emails to professors, I mostly got silence. I eventually found a supportive researcher named Dr. Veltri who shared the data I needed.Computers don't spend their free time in art museums. I needed to \"teach\" a computer to see tissue objects and encode them into compact numerical descriptors that a computer could understand. Like teaching Art Appreciation to someone who doesn't like art, I had to teach patterns and similarities, rather than meaning. Ultimately, I designed a feature extraction algorithm, Procist, to identify crucial elements: how textured and colored is the tissue? What is the spatial relationship and frequency of nuclei, glands, and stroma?Now I simply needed to find an AI algorithm to recognize patterns in Procist data. Digging into literature, I discovered that most studies recycled the same tired algorithms. Why not create my own?I agonized over this problem for weeks until my amateur culinary passion somehow inspired me. Spreading the final layer of mascarpone over a tray of espresso-soaked ladyfingers, I scribbled a few sudden thoughts on a kitchen towel. My AI would have a layered, tiramisu-style architecture! I called it SMLSVM, each layer converting digits into progressively abstract concepts until the data trickled to the bottom, where a final diagnosis would be made.I slowly trained SMLSVM on Procist data, and it began to \"see\" the patterns that differentiated prostate cancers. After advancing to Intel ISEF, I won 2nd Grand Award and a trip to tour CERN and exchange insight with brilliant researchers. A medical informatics company at Johns Hopkins heard about my work--I am now the Chief Innovation Hacker of Proscia Inc., a cancer diagnosis software company.I like teaching computers to see things our eyes can't, but working with my fellow students is even more rewarding. I currently mentor students through the adventure of science fair. At each workshop, we explore experimental design and brainstorm topics aligned with the students' passions. I also coordinate an international science magazine, one where dancers leap into the physiology of ballet and gamers charge into the psychology of Starcraft.Although science fairs happen only once or twice a year, I am determined bring this forum for creativity and problem solving to everyone, all year round. Everyone's talents and questions can add to human knowledge--that's something I can see, even without my glasses.",
    "Supps": "题目：Stanford students possess an intellectual vitality.

Look around--Google's self-driving cars will remove human error from the road. We can automate so many tasks with such speed and precision that someday, humans might be out of the picture.I thought this too. Proscia believed that we could revolutionize cancer diagnosis by building a digital pathologist. Computers were clearly faster and more analytical than human pathologists.But as I interviewed pathologists to determine what we could mimic through software, many of them insisted that diagnosis was not only science, but also art. It required compassion, interpretation, and an all-too-human intuition: things computers obviously lacked.This challenged me, so I dug deeper. I knew that computers were amazing calculators and data analysts--jobs humans aren't good at. However, humans can understand abstract concepts and ultimately, create. Machines can free us from mundane computation, leaving us more time and brainpower to unleash our creative faculties. Computers won't replace humanity; they can only enhance it.Our entire focus shifted. What could we do to bridge the two worlds? I understood that computers could process and display tons of data. But human insight, directed towards a chart, could discern unexpected relationships that a computer could not. So I designed a novel data visualization tool for prostate cancer biometrics, allowing doctors to explore data that had been preprocessed by a computer.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus.

Whatever the cost, I will find a way to stick a fridge in our room. I'm sure it'll also serve as an excellent closet.Experiencing different kinds of food feels like cave spelunking - sometimes, only intuition can guide you. Food defies language - no matter what culture you're from, we unite through just five basic flavors. You might need art history to understand Rothko, a music education to appreciate Penderecki, or a ballet background to comprehend Nijinsky. But anyone can delight in pierogi without knowing that it's Polish, or enjoy tajine without knowing that it's Morrocan.I'm a computer science and medicine geek, so I originally believed that cooking appealed to my right brain. But I've since realized that cooking and science are really the same thing. Cooking a great meal involves so many factors, processes, and techniques that a kitchen feels like a laboratory where odors should be sniffed, where chemicals should be tasted, where the fruits of your research are sometimes literally fruit, slowly poached in wine, spices, and herbs for a delicious compote.Ultimately, food satisfies hunger. But what food has taught me about science is that quality, passion, and diligence can create experiences beyond simply being full or answering our questions. And like research, great cuisine is so much more fulfilling when it's for a cause beyond ourselves.I pray that you have no dietary restrictions. We will absolutely shatter the freshman 15, together.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What matters to you, and why?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          I remember the fusion of cultures, languages, histories--a noisy communion that pervaded the elementary and middle school music room. But music became more of a solitary affair as I got older. In high school, everyone vanished into practice rooms, isolating themselves from the duets of years before. It seemed as if each musician in the orchestra were a soloist, and everyone else was simply a future competitor in a sonata competition.I understood that musicians had to develop their individual skills as they progressed. But couldn't they share along the way? Isn't that what music really is: sharing? Through my violin, I spun stories without words, and shared my emotions for any moment in time.My friends also understood that music was about sharing, so we founded the Students' Association for Young Artists, an environment where any student could discover music through free private group lessons from our fellow high school musicians. Although few musicians were willing to sacrifice their time in the beginning, the few who discovered how fulfilling teaching was told others. Eventually, we had so many mentors and students that only the maximum occupancy of the library limited us. Through us, over 70 students have explored the proper bow hold, the rich timbres on a saxophone, and the arduous, but exhilarating process of learning fingerpicking on a guitar.Today we coordinate two branches, and are continuing to grow. For us, music is no longer a solitary affair."

    "CommonApp": "The dressing room is a blur of shimmering fabric, partially clothed bodies, and mountains of make-up and bobby pins. I survey the landscape in dismay. Five minutes to my next scene and I still haven’t changed costumes. The phrase “break a leg”, frequently used to express good luck in live theater, takes a literal meaning as I struggle to simultaneously pull on an overstuffed dress and run to the stage. The curtain lifts, the spotlights flash, and I am transformed into a character from a faraway world.In eighth grade, I decided to audition for the Tri-District Arts Consortium (TriDAC), a three-week summer program in various areas of fine art. I was wavering between keyboarding and chorus when my friend suggested, as a joke, “Why not drama? Don’t be boring.” I laughed it off, but the idea of a performing in a live play, complete with flashy costumes and over- exaggerated facial expressions, began eroding my previous determinations. I decide to take the plunge.From the moment I step foot in the TriDAC auditorium to the last day of camp, every hour is a frenzy of energy and activity. The theater students are intimidatingly loud, wild, and flamboyantly outgoing—as a typically shy and quiet girl, I am completely and totally overwhelmed. I dread the day a counselor will circle by me during vocal warm-ups, yelling “RED LEATHER YELLOW LEATHER” in my face until I yell back with the same gusto. I dread the day I will miss a step during choreography and fall on my face. Most of all, I dread the day everyone will realize what I already suspect: I have made a terrible mistake in stepping so far outside my comfort zone.My only solace is knowing I am guaranteed a role in the final production, a musical version of “The Ugly Duckling” in which all characters are talking farm animals. I silently resign myself to a simple chorus role as the cast list is called.“Annie Hu...LowButt!” Shock. Then joy. Then panic.This was no chorus role; this was my own scene and solo as a unique and aptly named hen. This was a chance to prove myself, but also a chance to fail spectacularly in front of hundreds of strangers. I spend the next week immersing myself in the character, her feelings and motivations, her actions and appearance. Speaking in a British accent? Daunting, but not impossible. Waddling and squawking like a chicken? Uncomfortable and embarrassing, but not terrible. Wearing a fat-suit? Hilariously excellent. It happens so gradually I don’t even notice: I become comfortable with all the activities I dreaded at the beginning of camp, laughing and stomping my way through the warm-ups and dance routines, joining the “loud and wild” theater kids in musical numbers during lunch, and transforming into a farm animal with reckless abandon.All too soon, opening night arrives. We rush to the dark stage wings, listening to chatter from the audience and to our own frantic beating hearts. We run through frantic scene and costume changes, learning to adapt with broken microphones and forgotten lines. We dance and sing and act until our energy runs out, but we find the strength to keep going.I have been performing in live theater for years since that first performance at Tri-DAC, and the nerves and exhilaration of the first opening night never go away. Theater has taught me how to be fearless, how to be creative, how to throw myself fully into a pursuit without worrying what others will think. The pure essence of theater is letting go of inhibitions to reach an inner power, an inner determination to be anyone and anything I want, both onstage and offstage. To me, that is true strength.",

Joining MathCounts in sixth grade showed me how complex math could be and how little I knew. This complexity, however, only made math so much more interesting. I spent hours devouring problem solving books, always wanting more.When I first heard the term “AwesomeMath”, I laughed. While the name sounds silly, however, the camp was not. The classes were challenging, daily 3 hour lectures in two fields of mathematics, taught by brilliant mathematicians (one was a former IMO coach). We students shared a love of problem solving that diffused through every conversation, every word, every breath we exchanged. Surrounded by such talent and passion, I improved more than I ever thought possible.Beyond concepts, AwesomeMath taught me how to think, how to work, and how to live. I learned to spend days puzzling through problems, losing myself in the complexities of p-adic numbers or homography groups. I learned to collaborate effectively, bouncing ideas and strategies around like molecules until the perfect collision illuminated the path to a solution. I learned to broaden my perspective of the world around me, discovering applications of math in fields ranging from genetics to artificial intelligence.Three weeks passed in the blink of an eye, and an intangible sense of solidarity pervaded the entire camp, formed through hours of late night problem sets and discussions with thinkers who thirsted for knowledge and innovation. For the first time, at this “silly” camp, I felt truly at home.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus.

If you didn’t laugh, don’t worry, I have plenty more).Besides my appreciation of cheesy math puns, I have some other habits you should prepare for. I shudder at crinkled paper. I watch Jeopardy every night, calculating my potential wins as a contestant. I always eat chicken wings with a fork – it’s classy. I constantly hum show tunes, and will probably attempt to force my love of musicals on you as well. I cry every time an onscreen character cries. I can – and will – quote the entirety of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Finding Nemo, and (of course), Mean Girls.I like to keep myself occupied. I might stay up all night to perfect the conclusion of a paper, to watch a meteor shower, or to compete in a massive camp-wide water fight. I might even climb buildings at 3:00 AM to de-stress from final paper writing. I dream of visiting Paris, of proving the Goldbach Conjecture, of discovering the secrets of making perfectly crisp yet tender calamari. I MacGyvered AP Physics labs at home because I had the freedom to, and why not? I spend a lot of time with my computer, whether puzzling through problems on Project Euler or reaching level 350 on Candy Crush Saga (which some call “no life” but I regard as a testament to my patience and dedication). I won’t, however, spend much time in the room – there’s too much to experience and never enough time.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What matters to you, and why?

I have roots in the Society of Thespians, who raised me to be bold and adventurous. I have strong ties to the Mathematics tribe, who helped me embrace the all-work-but-some-play culture of math team, and with whom I share fond memories of crazy bus rides, grueling competitions, and many, many games of Ultimate Frisbee. I was recently adopted by a Council of Women in Technology, who gave me invaluable advice on building skills and careers in computer science, and inspired me to help spread CS education in my state. Finally, just this summer, I became “Ms. Hu-Rickoid” after meeting 80 wonderfully talented, motivated, and friendly students at the Research Science Institute. Through living together, running around Boston together, crying over paper-writing together, and spending countless hours discussing anything and everything together, we truly became a family.Communities matter to me – they have each poured and mixed their unique cultures to shape the particular, individual blend that is my life. My “extended families” stimulate me, move me to aspire and achieve higher, and make me learn and grow. At Stanford, I have the freedom to join the communities I have grown to love, to explore many more, and through them to leave my own impact on the world around me."

Suddenly all movement stops, and a man steps out, stroking his fresh grown beard around his smiling lips.“Success!” All the scientists in the room hug and cheer.The next day, newspapers headline, “Another big stride for genome research. DNA no longer a mystery!” A bioinformatics expert is quoted: “We are excited to have engineered a way to decipher “disorderly” codes in DNA sequences, letting us pinpoint and successfully activate the genes of Kevin’s beard pores. Our next goal is to configure ‘Santa-beard’ in time for Christmas!”“Hey! You’re dreaming again!” my friend scolds.I disappointingly returned to reality, the AP computer science classroom.“Sorry.”My mind was clouded by the recent success of the “ENCODE” project deciphering DNA ‘junk-genes’ (genes containing no information on the synthesis of proteins and chemicals in our bodies), and a separate investigation on DNA using Zipf's Law (a mathematics law for assessing linguistic attributes) concluding that junk-gene codes observed the same laws and features governing computer programming languages. Could they be the same?Having studied both biology and computer science, I realized in many ways DNA is similar to software codes. From having fault-tolerance ability (software’s ability to run with minor bugs, like our organic bodies), to having a stable number based-system (AGCT 4-bit system), to possessing a fully operatic competence (the sensitive transcription of protein from DNA data), DNA works like a sophisticated operating system, possessing a database of knowledge we have not accessed.We take for granted the self-regulatory mechanism in our bodies, but do we truly understand why insulin automatically secretes when glucose is present? Instead, biologists call it a phenomenon, much like the ‘phenomenon’ of diseases before Pasteur’s discovery of microorganisms. Other questions, such as “Why do we age?” and “Why do cancer cells replicate?” may be answered within the enigmatic DNA sequences.Even so, understanding is just a beginning. I know it is naive but I do envision sometime in the future, we may code DNA like we code software. When I program Java, I feel a sense of humility, knowing that with the right set of keystrokes, this keyboard alone can revolutionize how the world connects. Meanwhile genome, an existing fabulous set of code, is a powerful language we barely understand.Sixty years ago, before high-level programming languages, people could not envision the world today connected through ideas and information on small devices. Likewise, in sixty years, possibilities are immeasurable once we unravel DNA to understand our bodies.Beard-growth is perhaps trivial, but what about a heart or liver? Perhaps we may program bone marrow and the immune system, so that no disease is left uncured. Then, my dream—genomicists saving lives—will no longer be a fantasy, but a vision.",

Reflect on an idea or experience that has been important to your intellectual development.\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Having finished the PubMed reading assignments much faster than the graduate students, I bolstered with confidence when the professor asked me how.Feeling smug, I answered: \"Section by section? Like reading any textbook.\"Strangely, he didn't seem pleased. \"Listen, anyone can read, but we researchers analyze word by word. Did you scrutinize each sentence, and question every claim? Did you challenge the writing?\"That was the result of the naïve me stepping into laboratory for the first time at HuaZhong University, to conduct graduate-level research on systems biology. I was very involved, painstakingly sorting Caenorhabditis elegans with eyebrow strands, producing M9 buffer, and documenting conclusions, just like other researchers. Still to my annoyance, my professor and graduate friends never referred to me as a fellow researcher, but as 'the student'.\"Word by word\"\"Challenge the writing\" These words reminded me of demanding skeptics who are always too critical of other's effort. Furthermore, questioning every claim seemed like so much work.However, the professor made me rethink, realizing incredulity is the challenge and role of a scholar. It is the spirit of skepticism that distinguishes scholars from students: that many great leaps in science originated from doubt, even at the price of ridicule and contempt.Darwin asserted the theory of evolution to challenge the then widespread belief of Creationism. There is also Oswald Avery, who discovered DNA, disproving the prevalent belief that it was cell protein that contained genetic information. The history of science is a record of skepticism, of challenging ideas and proposing new rationales. Skepticism is what ensures science never remains stagnant.As a student, I lived a guided life with eyes and ears open, but never once guided myself with open voice and mind. Now moving on, I know to be skeptical in face of ridicule, to question facts from multiple viewpoints, and to reserve my credulity.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus.

This College Edition roommate, like many other goods, is made in China. Main features include hogging space and ruining perfectly good lab experiments, but be sure to read this personal manual thoroughly to make the most of my capabilities.1. Do recognize my voice well, because my appearance is not reliable. It is commonly subject to self-experimentation, such as the time I shaved my eyebrows to test their growth speed. (If you are curious, it takes four months to return – four long months of ostracism.)2. Ping Pong feature is not included, but basketball (High School Edition) has been preprogrammed.3. I am often found testing Newton mechanics and conservation of momentum with sandbags (If the dorm allows). Therefore, please be wary of noise, and remain calm. Do not try to unplug me at this time.4. On the subject of noise, you may commonly find yourself waking up serenely to charming jazz melodies I play on the clarinet.You may also find yourself assaulting me for blaring staccatos I play in times of stress. Unfortunately, under threat I am programmed to respond with (5)5. Physical combat. I am highly adept at Taekwondo.(Hence sandbags)We Taekwondo trainers don't fight except in emergencies, but I cannot guarantee your safety when enraged.(LOL, I am kidding)6. I come attached with a curious nature and 3TB of memory space ready for the US culture update. This requires that he be fully acclimated soon, with in depth understanding of America football.Joking aside, you can see that my friends regard me as unique for a reason, but I assure you these are very close friends. I may be the silly chatterbox, but I am always there for friends in need. I'm not a strange, violence-prone, music fanatic bent on world dominance.(At least for now) I just look forward to meeting another stranger from another place, to share college experiences with.See you soon!\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What matters to you, and why?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          The pedestrians couldn't help stopping, forming a half-circle. I looked up, greeted by beige walls dotted with clusters of brilliant red flowers. The faint words \"Mozarts geburtshaus\" were vaguely distinguished on the wall.With three friends, we stood in the middle of Mozartplatz basking in the splendor of playing the clarinet in front of Mozart's former residence. This Mozart's A major Concerto was our best gift to Salzburg. When the concerto was done, not only did the crowd burst into enthusiastic applause with cries of \"Bravo\", but the statue of Mozart nearby seemed to smile approvingly.As a participant in the International Youth Art Festival 2012 in Pisek, Czech Republic, the last thing on my mind was to play in public. As members of one of the best student orchestras in China, our devotion to music must be respected by tuxedoes and gowns. Real music is something we gaze upwards to appreciate, within the enclosed concert hall that captures 'true essence' of music – not found disrespected along streets.However, Europe is the magical land of music. No matter in Prague, Frankfurt, or Vienna, and no matter on a bridge or in a pub, musicians are everywhere. It may be a man with his homemade percussion set consisting of two egg-beaters and a spatula, or a rogue band consisting of only trombones and trumpets. Perhaps because here is the birthplace of Mozart, or because of the dedicated musicians whose music seems unfettered by their surrounding, we were compelled to join.On the street, people of all backgrounds were brought together by our music, even without 'full-essence'. That was when I realized Mozart did not compose music to simply suit the acoustics of lavish concert halls, but to create brilliance that can be spread indiscriminately.In that spirit, we returned to China, stepping on the Metro with assembled clarinets in hand. No matter what people think, our intents are most clear: As long as we use our hearts to impart music, we impart true essence."

    "CommonApp": "My letter read, “Lisa, you’ve done so much just by being there for your family every day. That’s enough for you to kick your rockets back into action, blast off through the atmosphere, and explode into the universe of awesome. That’s where you belong, Lisa.” I’d never met Lisa.Lisa was my first letter, a September request by an online organization called More Love Letters (MLL). To souls in need of emotional support, MLL offers the handwritten efforts of a community of complete strangers. In taking up our charge, we receive a paragraph about our subject’s suffering–it could be cancer, the loss of a loved one, or just plain stress. So when I read Lisa’s paragraph, I felt an urge to connect with her, a college sophomore who loved Doctor Who and making terrible puns but struggled to stay positive after she’d lost her mother. In that hour I crafted, snipped, pasted, and glittered up my first response.As I cleaned up the aftermath of that letter, I noticed that I felt somehow different, like I’d set off a wave in one of the universe’s many strings. I was struck by how I’d just reveled in one of humanity’s most sophisticated emotions, empathy. Submerging in that awareness of self was so sublime an experience that I had no choice but to share it with others. Thus, I founded the [high school name] Campus Cursive Chapter (an extension of MLL) to give that same plunge into empathy to my classmates. The chapter blossomed; when students found our uplifting little notes hidden around campus and posted on Facebook, “That made my day,” I marveled at how small actions could make such huge ripples. When I got the student body to write nearly 500 notes, all filled with quips and genuine appreciation, to the faculty, I vowed to uncover all the latent love that I knew must lie hidden in every community. When a freshman came up to me and asked if she could write to more people, I knew that sharing this chance to explore empathy was truly magical.Now, 752 letters later, when looking back on the first, I realize my initial empathetic exploration gave me more than just fleeting happiness: I found real, lasting meaning. In trying to understand Lisa, I’d searched for a second self, ripping my focus away from my high school existence and two-parent household to envision life without a mother. In doing so, I felt so much more human because I’d expanded beyond my tiny consciousness into the alternative perspective of another.Paradoxically, forgetting myself granted me greater personal clarity. To tap into her feelings of loss, I’d had to sift through my own experiences for the truth on how to cope. I was propelled back to sophomore year, when I lost a classmate to suicide, and remembered how hard I had struggled to empathize with everyone else who was left behind, especially her best friend. Serendipitously, Lisa gave me the chance to reexamine how I understood death, how to mourn, and I finally found closure in both our losses. It’s funny how when we send love out into the universe, the universe sometimes sends self-knowledge back. I treasure this awareness outside myself and the moment, free of the trivialities of everyday life, full of the feeling of wonder. Today still, I write love letters because I long to be a cog in the great cosmic machine that produces proof that being human is a privileged experience.",

What makes itunconstitutional? What exactly is Sharia law? Should I be happy or sad? Having recently analyzed the state of religious freedom for American Sikhs, I was on the alert for ethnic intolerance and the marginalization of another religious “other.” Yet as a feminist who’s read her fair share of Khaled Hosseini, I was suspicious of Sharia law. Seeking further clarification through news articles and advocacy websites provided no insight, only the back-and-forth ricochet of easy opinion lacking deeper interrogation.Through a foray into Constitutional language at the Yale Young Global Scholars program this summer, however, I found clarity. Studying selected court cases involving marriage law, I discovered precedents deeming Sharia law neither more noteworthy nor less immune to scrutiny than other religious codes such as Jewish ketubah practices. Just as the First Amendment’s Free Exercise clause validated the Torah’s claim upon Jewish husbands to compensate their wives financially upon divorce, so Houida Odatalla’s mahr, or Islamic prenuptial stating the same, was affirmed. After clearing through the noise of prejudice, reaching that sound conclusion was refreshing. In legal discourse, I’d finally found a stable mechanism immune to fear and bigotry for establishing informed opinions. That mechanism also dispelled my own bigotry, demonstrating that Sharia law can at times protect women and therefore requires a far more nuanced reception than Oklahoma initially realized.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus.

When guacamole’s consistency implies that it could have emerged from certain bodily orifices, and shrimp has too many legs and tendons that snap all too easily, how will we ever participate in the ultimate bonding experience of shoveling in twice our normal daily caloric intake in the wee hours of the morning?Instead, I guess we could craft sonnets about The Fresh Prince and seductive breakfast items (“To His Coy Bagel”), or play Cards Against Humanity (imagine politically incorrect, obscene Apples to Apples). If you shun the risqué, you can elect for my Close Friend eccentric bonding tradition: rapid-fire, aggressive attempts to upstage each other’s witty insults as we cackle at non sequitur and forgive the banal tropes of popular TV shows. To balance the snark, we’ll store daily notes of shared happy memories in a jar. We’ll conquer the horror genre with our eyes covered and burst into impromptu dance-offs.And even if you erect closet shrines to seafood and once illegally smuggled guacamole across certain national borders, even if you founded your local Anti-Fresh Prince club, even if you love every single thing I hate and we have nothing in common, I know we’ll both look after each other. Our hearts lie where the home is, and if my home is with you, then I don’t care how different we are – I’ve never had a problem making friendships meaningful.Nice to meet you, I’m Connie.\n                                      \n                                  \n                              \n                          \n                              \n                                  题目：What matters to you, and why?\n                                  \n                                      \n                                          Senator Leticia Van de Putte asked, “Mr. President, at what point must a female senator raise her voice to be recognized over the male colleagues in the room?”––and all hell broke loose. Watching the livestream, I virtually roared with the gallery, triumphantly closing Texas Senator Wendy Davis’ 11 hour-filibuster against Senate Bill 5. Despite our ultimate defeat, it’s clear the real last frontier for humanity is not the West, space, or even AI. As evidenced by Wendy Davis’ filibuster, it lies in the recognition of female bodily integrity as the cultural norm.From Michigan’s legislation requiring preemptive insurance for pregnancy from rape to Texas SB5’s restriction of abortion access, women’s reproductive rights are increasingly under siege. How is it that since 1995, U.S. states have enacted 755 anti-choice measures, when most countries offer paid pregnancy leave and Bangladesh recognizes a third gender? Since oral drugs for terminating pregnancies have existed since the Middle Ages, I call anti-choice legislation even more medieval than medieval.Ultimately, I’m fighting to change a culture that demonizes and shames my female body, locks it under the shoddy justification of false morality and tradition, and declares it noble, good, and normal to wrest away my agency through legislation. But this is mine.This is my freedom. This is a place under my control alone, where neither ideology, politics, nor ignorance may enter. The right to choose matters to me because it means finally integrating women as free agents, with free bodies, into civil society."
